SUBJECT: NASA Federal Source Code Framework

This memo defines NASA OCIO activities and provides roles and responsibilities to ensure compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) M-16-21 "Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software."

In 2016, OMB released M-16-21, which seeks to ensure that new custom-developed Federal source code be made broadly available for reuse across the Federal Government. M-16-21 also requires agencies, when commissioning new custom software, to release at least 20 percent of new custom-developed code as Open Source Software (OSS) for three years, and to collect data concerning new custom software to gauge performance. This approach is consistent with the Digital Government Strategy "Shared Platform" approach, which enables federal employees to work together both within and across agencies to reduce costs, streamline development, apply uniform standards, and ensure consistency in creating and delivering information.

NASA OCIO is the responsible office for developing, maintaining, disseminating, and implementing new policy and procedural requirements of M-16-21.

The following actions are assigned to the NASA OCIO nformation Management Office:

By December 6, 2016: Inventory and publish a machine-readable source code project inventory that conforms to the code.json schema for cataloging metadata of code projects on code.nasa.gov.

Annually, beginning in FY 2017: Release a minimum of 20% of custom code as Open Source Software each year. The percentage calculation shall be based on the total number of code projccts in the code inventory.

By July 2017: In coordination with the Office of Procurement and the Office of General Counsel, develop and implement a policy or process that requires NASA to apply the 3-Step Software Solutions Analysis (as outlined in the M-16-21) during procurement phase for new IT systems. When contracting for developer services, NASA will encourage vendors to use open source technology wherever possible.

By FY 2018: Implement a policy or process that will ensure appropriate ights to custom code, recognizing that a vast majority of code produced within NASA is written by contractors. In order to increase the percentage of delivery of source code using free and open licensing, OCIO will work with the OMB code.gov and Tech Transfer teams to develop core contract language to disseminate within the agency. NASA OCIO will coordinate with the Office of Procurement, Office of General Counsel, Office of the Chief Engineer, the Space Technology Mission Directorate, and other stakeholders to ensure appropriate contract language is in place by FY 2018.

More information about the implementation of these requirements wil follow. This is for your general awareness. The OCIO will work to meet the initial inventory of machine- readable source code for the December 2016 milestone. All questions regarding this memo should be directed to Jason Duley at (650) 604-1834 or jason.duley@nasa.gov.

BeginPreface

This is a book about Natural Language Processing. By "natural language" we mean a language that is used for everyday communication by humans; languages like English, Hindi or Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as programming languages and mathematical notations, natural languages have evolved as they pass from generation to generation, and are hard to pin down with explicit rules. We will take Natural Language Processing ‚Äî or NLP for short ‚Äî in a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme, NLP involves "understanding" complete human utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful responses to them.

Technologies based on NLP are becoming increasingly widespread. For example, phones and handheld computers support predictive text and handwriting recognition; web search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured text; machine translation allows us to retrieve texts written in Chinese and read them in Spanish; text analysis enables us to detect sentiment in tweets and blogs. By providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more sophisticated access to stored information, language processing has come to play a central role in the multilingual information society.

This book provides a highly accessible introduction to the field of NLP. It can be used for individual study or as the textbook for a course on natural language processing or computational linguistics, or as a supplement to courses in artificial intelligence, text mining, or corpus linguistics. The book is intensely practical, containing hundreds of fully-worked examples and graded exercises.

The book is based on the Python programming language together with an open source library called the¬†Natural Language Toolkit¬†(NLTK). NLTK includes extensive software, data, and documentation, all freely downloadable from¬†http://nltk.org/. Distributions are provided for Windows, Macintosh and Unix platforms. We strongly encourage you to download Python and NLTK, and try out the examples and exercises along the way.

Audience

NLP is important for scientific, economic, social, and cultural reasons. NLP is experiencing rapid growth as its theories and methods are deployed in a variety of new language technologies. For this reason it is important for a wide range of people to have a working knowledge of NLP. Within industry, this includes people in human-computer interaction, business information analysis, and web software development. Within academia, it includes people in areas from humanities computing and corpus linguistics through to computer science and artificial intelligence. (To many people in academia, NLP is known by the name of "Computational Linguistics.")

This book is intended for a diverse range of people who want to learn how to write programs that analyze written language, regardless of previous programming experience:

New to programming?:¬†The early chapters of the book are suitable for readers with no prior knowledge of programming, so long as you aren't afraid to tackle new concepts and develop new computing skills. The book is full of examples that you can copy and try for yourself, together with hundreds of graded exercises. If you need a more general introduction to Python, see the list of Python resources at¬†http://docs.python.org/.New to Python?:Experienced programmers can quickly learn enough Python using this book to get immersed in natural language processing. All relevant Python features are carefully explained and exemplified, and you will quickly come to appreciate Python's suitability for this application area. The language index will help you locate relevant discussions in the book.Already dreaming in Python?:¬†Skim the Python examples and dig into the interesting language analysis material that starts in¬†1.. You'll soon be applying your skills to this fascinating domain.

Emphasis

This book is a¬†practical¬†introduction to NLP. You will learn by example, write real programs, and grasp the value of being able to test an idea through implementation. If you haven't learnt already, this book will teach you¬†programming. Unlike other programming books, we provide extensive illustrations and exercises from NLP. The approach we have taken is also¬†principled, in that we cover the theoretical underpinnings and don't shy away from careful linguistic and computational analysis. We have tried to be¬†pragmatic¬†in striking a balance between theory and application, identifying the connections and the tensions. Finally, we recognize that you won't get through this unless it is also¬†pleasurable, so we have tried to include many applications and examples that are interesting and entertaining, sometimes whimsical.

Note that this book is not a reference work. Its coverage of Python and NLP is selective, and presented in a tutorial style. For reference material, please consult the substantial quantity of searchable resources available at¬†http://python.org/¬†and¬†http://nltk.org/.

This book is not an advanced computer science text. The content ranges from introductory to intermediate, and is directed at readers who want to learn how to analyze text using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit. To learn about advanced algorithms implemented in NLTK, you can examine the Python code linked from¬†http://nltk.org/, and consult the other materials cited in this book.

What You Will Learn

By digging into the material presented here, you will learn:

How simple programs can help you manipulate and analyze language data, and how to write these programs

How key concepts from NLP and linguistics are used to describe and analyse language

How data structures and algorithms are used in NLP

How language data is stored in standard formats, and how data can be used to evaluate the performance of NLP techniques

Depending on your background, and your motivation for being interested in NLP, you will gain different kinds of skills and knowledge from this book, as set out in¬†III.1.

Organization

The early chapters are organized in order of conceptual difficulty, starting with a practical introduction to language processing that shows how to explore interesting bodies of text using tiny Python programs (Chapters 1-3). This is followed by a chapter on structured programming (Chapter 4) that consolidates the programming topics scattered across the preceding chapters. After this, the pace picks up, and we move on to a series of chapters covering fundamental topics in language processing: tagging, classification, and information extraction (Chapters 5-7). The next three chapters look at ways to parse a sentence, recognize its syntactic structure, and construct representations of meaning (Chapters 8-10). The final chapter is devoted to linguistic data and how it can be managed effectively (Chapter 11). The book concludes with an Afterword, briefly discussing the past and future of the field.

Within each chapter, we switch between different styles of presentation. In one style, natural language is the driver. We analyze language, explore linguistic concepts, and use programming examples to support the discussion. We often employ Python constructs that have not been introduced systematically, so you can see their purpose before delving into the details of how and why they work. This is just like learning idiomatic expressions in a foreign language: you're able to buy a nice pastry without first having learnt the intricacies of question formation. In the other style of presentation, the programming language will be the driver. We'll analyze programs, explore algorithms, and the linguistic examples will play a supporting role.

Each chapter ends with a series of graded exercises, which are useful for consolidating the material. The exercises are graded according to the following scheme: ‚òº is for easy exercises that involve minor modifications to supplied code samples or other simple activities; ‚óë is for intermediate exercises that explore an aspect of the material in more depth, requiring careful analysis and design; ‚òÖ is for difficult, open-ended tasks that will challenge your understanding of the material and force you to think independently (readers new to programming should skip these).

Each chapter has a further reading section and an online "extras" section at¬†http://nltk.org/, with pointers to more advanced materials and online resources. Online versions of all the code examples are also available there.

Why Python?

Python is a simple yet powerful programming language with excellent functionality for processing linguistic data. Python can be downloaded for free from¬†http://python.org/. Installers are available for all platforms.

Here is a five-line Python program that processes¬†file.txt¬†and prints all the words ending in¬†ing:

¬†>>> for line in open("file.txt"): ... for word in line.split(): ... if word.endswith('ing'): ... print(word)

This program illustrates some of the main features of Python. First, whitespace is used to¬†nest¬†lines of code, thus the line starting with¬†if¬†falls inside the scope of the previous line starting with¬†for; this ensures that the¬†ing¬†test is performed for each word. Second, Python is¬†object-oriented; each variable is an entity that has certain defined attributes and methods. For example, the value of the variable¬†line¬†is more than a sequence of characters. It is a string object that has a "method" (or operation) called¬†split()¬†that we can use to break a line into its words. To apply a method to an object, we write the object name, followed by a period, followed by the method name, i.e.¬†line.split(). Third, methods have¬†arguments¬†expressed inside parentheses. For instance, in the example,¬†word.endswith('ing')¬†had the argument¬†'ing'¬†to indicate that we wanted words ending with¬†ing¬†and not something else. Finally ‚Äî and most importantly ‚Äî Python is highly readable, so much so that it is fairly easy to guess what the program does even if you have never written a program before.

We chose Python because it has a shallow learning curve, its syntax and semantics are transparent, and it has good string-handling functionality. As an interpreted language, Python facilitates interactive exploration. As an object-oriented language, Python permits data and methods to be encapsulated and re-used easily. As a dynamic language, Python permits attributes to be added to objects on the fly, and permits variables to be typed dynamically, facilitating rapid development. Python comes with an extensive standard library, including components for graphical programming, numerical processing, and web connectivity.

Python is heavily used in industry, scientific research, and education around the world. Python is often praised for the way it facilitates productivity, quality, and maintainability of software. A collection of Python success stories is posted at¬†http://python.org/about/success/.

NLTK defines an infrastructure that can be used to build NLP programs in Python. It provides basic classes for representing data relevant to natural language processing; standard interfaces for performing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and text classification; and standard implementations for each task which can be combined to solve complex problems.

NLTK comes with extensive documentation. In addition to this book, the website at¬†http://nltk.org/¬†provides API documentation that covers every module, class and function in the toolkit, specifying parameters and giving examples of usage.

Python 3 and NLTK 3

This version of the book has been updated to support Python 3 and NLTK 3. Python 3 includes some significant changes:

the¬†print¬†statement is now a function requiring parentheses;

many functions now return iterators instead of lists (to save memory usage);

integer division returns a floating point number

all text is now Unicode

strings are formatted using the¬†format¬†method

For a more detailed list of changes, please see¬†https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.0.html. There is a utility called¬†2to3.py¬†which can convert your Python 2 code to Python 3; for details please see¬†https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html.

NLTK also includes some pervasive changes:

many types are initialised from strings using a¬†fromstring()¬†method

many functions now return iterators instead of lists

ContextFreeGrammar¬†is now called¬†CFG¬†and¬†WeightedGrammar¬†is now called¬†PCFG

batch_tokenize()¬†is now called¬†tokenize_sents(); there are corresponding changes for batch taggers, parsers, and classifiers

some implementations have been removed in favour of external packages, or because they could not be maintained adequately

For a more detailed list of changes, please see¬†https://github.com/nltk/nltk/wiki/Porting-your-code-to-NLTK-3.0.

For visualizing semantic networks, also install the¬†Graphviz¬†library.Prover9:(optional) This is an automated theorem prover for first-order and equational logic, used to support inference in language processing.

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

NLTK was originally created in 2001 as part of a computational linguistics course in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Since then it has been developed and expanded with the help of dozens of contributors. It has now been adopted in courses in dozens of universities, and serves as the basis of many research projects. See¬†VIII.1¬†for a list of the most important NLTK modules.

NLTK was designed with four primary goals in mind:

Simplicity:To provide an intuitive framework along with substantial building blocks, giving users a practical knowledge of NLP without getting bogged down in the tedious house-keeping usually associated with processing annotated language dataConsistency:To provide a uniform framework with consistent interfaces and data structures, and easily-guessable method namesExtensibility:To provide a structure into which new software modules can be easily accommodated, including alternative implementations and competing approaches to the same taskModularity:To provide components that can be used independently without needing to understand the rest of the toolkit

Contrasting with these goals are three non-requirements ‚Äî potentially useful qualities that we have deliberately avoided. First, while the toolkit provides a wide range of functions, it is not encyclopedic; it is a toolkit, not a system, and it will continue to evolve with the field of NLP. Second, while the toolkit is efficient enough to support meaningful tasks, it is not highly optimized for runtime performance; such optimizations often involve more complex algorithms, or implementations in lower-level programming languages such as C or C++. This would make the software less readable and more difficult to install. Third, we have tried to avoid clever programming tricks, since we believe that clear implementations are preferable to ingenious yet indecipherable ones.

For Instructors

Natural Language Processing is often taught within the confines of a single-semester course at advanced undergraduate level or postgraduate level. Many instructors have found that it is difficult to cover both the theoretical and practical sides of the subject in such a short span of time. Some courses focus on theory to the exclusion of practical exercises, and deprive students of the challenge and excitement of writing programs to automatically process language. Other courses are simply designed to teach programming for linguists, and do not manage to cover any significant NLP content. NLTK was originally developed to address this problem, making it feasible to cover a substantial amount of theory and practice within a single-semester course, even if students have no prior programming experience.

A significant fraction of any NLP syllabus deals with algorithms and data structures. On their own these can be rather dry, but NLTK brings them to life with the help of interactive graphical user interfaces that make it possible to view algorithms step-by-step. Most NLTK components include a demonstration that performs an interesting task without requiring any special input from the user. An effective way to deliver the materials is through interactive presentation of the examples in this book, entering them in a Python session, observing what they do, and modifying them to explore some empirical or theoretical issue.

This book contains hundreds of exercises that can be used as the basis for student assignments. The simplest exercises involve modifying a supplied program fragment in a specified way in order to answer a concrete question. At the other end of the spectrum, NLTK provides a flexible framework for graduate-level research projects, with standard implementations of all the basic data structures and algorithms, interfaces to dozens of widely used datasets (corpora), and a flexible and extensible architecture. Additional support for teaching using NLTK is available on the NLTK website.

We believe this book is unique in providing a comprehensive framework for students to learn about NLP in the context of learning to program. What sets these materials apart is the tight coupling of the chapters and exercises with NLTK, giving students ‚Äî even those with no prior programming experience ‚Äî a practical introduction to NLP. After completing these materials, students will be ready to attempt one of the more advanced textbooks, such as¬†Speech and Language Processing, by Jurafsky and Martin (Prentice Hall, 2008).

This book presents programming concepts in an unusual order, beginning with a non-trivial data type ‚Äî lists of strings ‚Äî then introducing non-trivial control structures such as comprehensions and conditionals. These idioms permit us to do useful language processing from the start. Once this motivation is in place, we return to a systematic presentation of fundamental concepts such as strings, loops, files, and so forth. In this way, we cover the same ground as more conventional approaches, without expecting readers to be interested in the programming language for its own sake.

Two possible course plans are illustrated in¬†IX.1. The first one presumes an arts/humanities audience, whereas the second one presumes a science/engineering audience. Other course plans could cover the first five chapters, then devote the remaining amount of time to a single area, such as text classification (Chapters 6-7), syntax (Chapters 8-9), semantics (Chapter 10), or linguistic data management (Chapter 11).

8. Analyzing Sentence Structure

Earlier chapters focused on words: how to identify them, analyze their structure, assign them to lexical categories, and access their meanings. We have also seen how to identify patterns in word sequences or n-grams. However, these methods only scratch the surface of the complex constraints that govern sentences. We need a way to deal with the ambiguity that natural language is famous for. We also need to be able to cope with the fact that there are an unlimited number of possible sentences, and we can only write finite programs to analyze their structures and discover their meanings.

The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:

How can we use a formal grammar to describe the structure of an unlimited set of sentences?

How do we represent the structure of sentences using syntax trees?

How do parsers analyze a sentence and automatically build a syntax tree?

Along the way, we will cover the fundamentals of English syntax, and see that there are systematic aspects of meaning that are much easier to capture once we have identified the structure of sentences.

1¬†¬†¬†Some Grammatical Dilemmas

1.1¬†¬†¬†Linguistic Data and Unlimited Possibilities

Previous chapters have shown you how to process and analyse text corpora, and we have stressed the challenges for NLP in dealing with the vast amount of electronic language data that is growing daily. Let's consider this data more closely, and make the thought experiment that we have a gigantic corpus consisting of everything that has been either uttered or written in English over, say, the last 50 years. Would we be justified in calling this corpus "the language of modern English"? There are a number of reasons why we might answer No. Recall that in¬†3, we asked you to search the web for instances of the pattern¬†the of. Although it is easy to find examples on the web containing this word sequence, such as¬†New man at the of IMG¬†(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2387900/New-man-at-the-of-IMG.html), speakers of English will say that most such examples are errors, and therefore not part of English after all.

Accordingly, we can argue that the "modern English" is not equivalent to the very big set of word sequences in our imaginary corpus. Speakers of English can make judgements about these sequences, and will reject some of them as being ungrammatical.

Equally, it is easy to compose a new sentence and have speakers agree that it is perfectly good English. For example, sentences have an interesting property that they can be embedded inside larger sentences. Consider the following sentences:

(1)

a.Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

b.The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

c.Andre said The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

d.I think Andre said the Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

If we replaced whole sentences with the symbol¬†S, we would see patterns like¬†Andre said¬†S¬†and¬†I think¬†S. These are templates for taking a sentence and constructing a bigger sentence. There are other templates we can use, like¬†S¬†but¬†S, and¬†S¬†when¬†S. With a bit of ingenuity we can construct some really long sentences using these templates. Here's an impressive example from a Winnie the Pooh story by A.A. Milne,¬†In which Piglet is Entirely Surrounded by Water:

[You can imagine Piglet's joy when at last the ship came in sight of him.] In after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very Great Danger during the Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had really been in was the last half-hour of his imprisonment, when Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort him, and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid a seagull's egg by mistake, and the story went on and on, rather like this sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his window without much hope, went to sleep quietly and naturally, slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until he was only hanging on by his toes, at which moment, luckily, a sudden loud squawk from Owl, which was really part of the story, being what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself back into safety and say, "How interesting, and did she?" when ‚Äî well, you can imagine his joy when at last he saw the good ship, Brain of Pooh (Captain, C. Robin; 1st Mate, P. Bear) coming over the sea to rescue him...

This long sentence actually has a simple structure that begins¬†S but S when S. We can see from this example that language provides us with constructions which seem to allow us to extend sentences indefinitely. It is also striking that we can understand sentences of arbitrary length that we've never heard before: it's not hard to concoct an entirely novel sentence, one that has probably never been used before in the history of the language, yet all speakers of the language will understand it.

The purpose of a grammar is to give an explicit description of a language. But the way in which we think of a grammar is closely intertwined with what we consider to be a language. Is it a large but finite set of observed utterances and written texts? Is it something more abstract like the implicit knowledge that competent speakers have about grammatical sentences? Or is it some combination of the two? We won't take a stand on this issue, but instead will introduce the main approaches.

In this chapter, we will adopt the formal framework of "generative grammar", in which a "language" is considered to be nothing more than an enormous collection of all grammatical sentences, and a grammar is a formal notation that can be used for "generating" the members of this set. Grammars use recursive¬†productions¬†of the form¬†S¬†‚Üí¬†S¬†and¬†S, as we will explore in¬†3. In¬†10.¬†we will extend this, to automatically build up the meaning of a sentence out of the meanings of its parts.

1.2¬†¬†¬†Ubiquitous Ambiguity

A well-known example of ambiguity is shown in¬†(2), from the Groucho Marx movie,¬†Animal Crackers¬†(1930):

(2)While hunting in Africa, I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas, I don't know.

Let's take a closer look at the ambiguity in the phrase:¬†I shot an elephant in my pajamas. First we need to define a simple grammar:

¬†>>> groucho_grammar = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" ... S -> NP VP ... PP -> P NP ... NP -> Det N | Det N PP | 'I' ... VP -> V NP | VP PP ... Det -> 'an' | 'my' ... N -> 'elephant' | 'pajamas' ... V -> 'shot' ... P -> 'in' ... """)

This grammar permits the sentence to be analyzed in two ways, depending on whether the prepositional phrase¬†in my pajamas¬†describes the elephant or the shooting event.

¬†>>> sent = ['I', 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas'] >>> parser = nltk.ChartParser(groucho_grammar) >>> for tree in parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) ... (S (NP I) (VP (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant))) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))) (S (NP I) (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))))

The program produces two bracketed structures, which we can depict as trees, as shown in¬†(3b):

(3)

a.Ôøº

b.Ôøº

Notice that there's no ambiguity concerning the meaning of any of the words; e.g. the word¬†shot¬†doesn't refer to the act of using a gun in the first sentence, and using a camera in the second sentence.

Note

Your Turn:¬†Consider the following sentences and see if you can think of two quite different interpretations:¬†Fighting animals could be dangerous.¬†Visiting relatives can be tiresome.¬†Is ambiguity of the individual words to blame? If not, what is the cause of the ambiguity?

This chapter presents grammars and parsing, as the formal and computational methods for investigating and modeling the linguistic phenomena we have been discussing. As we shall see, patterns of well-formedness and ill-formedness in a sequence of words can be understood with respect to the phrase structure and dependencies. We can develop formal models of these structures using grammars and parsers. As before, a key motivation is natural language¬†understanding. How much more of the meaning of a text can we access when we can reliably recognize the linguistic structures it contains? Having read in a text, can a program "understand" it enough to be able to answer simple questions about "what happened" or "who did what to whom"? Also as before, we will develop simple programs to process annotated corpora and perform useful tasks.

2¬†¬†¬†What's the Use of Syntax?

2.1¬†¬†¬†Beyond n-grams

We gave an example in¬†2.¬†of how to use the frequency information in bigrams to generate text that seems perfectly acceptable for small sequences of words but rapidly degenerates into nonsense. Here's another pair of examples that we created by computing the bigrams over the text of a childrens' story,¬†The Adventures of Buster Brown¬†(http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22816/22816.txt):

(4)

a.He roared with me the pail slip down his back

b.The worst part and clumsy looking for whoever heard light

You intuitively know that these sequences are "word-salad", but you probably find it hard to pin down what's wrong with them. One benefit of studying grammar is that it provides a conceptual framework and vocabulary for spelling out these intuitions. Let's take a closer look at the sequence¬†the worst part and clumsy looking. This looks like a¬†coordinate structure, where two phrases are joined by a coordinating conjunction such as¬†and,¬†but¬†or¬†or. Here's an informal (and simplified) statement of how coordination works syntactically:

Coordinate Structure:

If¬†v1¬†and¬†v2¬†are both phrases of grammatical category¬†X, then¬†v1¬†and¬†v2¬†is also a phrase of category¬†X.

Here are a couple of examples. In the first, two¬†NPs (noun phrases) have been conjoined to make an¬†NP, while in the second, two¬†APs (adjective phrases) have been conjoined to make an¬†AP.

(5)

a.The book's ending was (NP¬†the worst part and the best part) for me.

b.On land they are (AP¬†slow and clumsy looking).

What we¬†can't¬†do is conjoin an¬†NP¬†and an¬†AP, which is why¬†the worst part and clumsy looking¬†is ungrammatical. Before we can formalize these ideas, we need to understand the concept of¬†constituent structure.

Constituent structure is based on the observation that words combine with other words to form units. The evidence that a sequence of words forms such a unit is given by substitutability ‚Äî that is, a sequence of words in a well-formed sentence can be replaced by a shorter sequence without rendering the sentence ill-formed. To clarify this idea, consider the following sentence:

(6)The little bear saw the fine fat trout in the brook.

The fact that we can substitute¬†He¬†for¬†The little bear¬†indicates that the latter sequence is a unit. By contrast, we cannot replace¬†little bear saw¬†in the same way.

(7)

a.He saw the fine fat trout in the brook.

b.*The he the fine fat trout in the brook.

In¬†2.1, we systematically substitute longer sequences by shorter ones in a way which preserves grammaticality. Each sequence that forms a unit can in fact be replaced by a single word, and we end up with just two elements.

Ôøº

Figure 2.1: Substitution of Word Sequences: working from the top row, we can replace particular sequences of words (e.g.¬†the brook) with individual words (e.g.¬†it); repeating this process we arrive at a grammatical two-word sentence.

In¬†2.2, we have added grammatical category labels to the words we saw in the earlier figure. The labels¬†NP,¬†VP, and¬†PP¬†stand for¬†noun phrase,¬†verb phrase¬†and¬†prepositional phrase¬†respectively.

Ôøº

Figure 2.2: Substitution of Word Sequences Plus Grammatical Categories: This diagram reproduces¬†2.1¬†along with grammatical categories corresponding to noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), prepositional phrases (PP), and nominals (Nom).

If we now strip out the words apart from the topmost row, add an¬†S¬†node, and flip the figure over, we end up with a standard phrase structure tree, shown in¬†(8). Each node in this tree (including the words) is called a¬†constituent. The¬†immediate constituents¬†of¬†S¬†are¬†NP¬†and¬†VP.

(8)Ôøº

As we will see in the next section, a grammar specifies how the sentence can be subdivided into its immediate constituents, and how these can be further subdivided until we reach the level of individual words.

Note

As we saw in¬†1, sentences can have arbitrary length. Consequently, phrase structure trees can have arbitrary¬†depth. The cascaded chunk parsers we saw in¬†4¬†can only produce structures of bounded depth, so chunking methods aren't applicable here.

3¬†¬†¬†Context Free Grammar

3.1¬†¬†¬†A Simple Grammar

Let's start off by looking at a simple context-free grammar. By convention, the left-hand-side of the first production is the¬†start-symbol¬†of the grammar, typically¬†S, and all well-formed trees must have this symbol as their root label. In NLTK, context-free grammars are defined in the¬†nltk.grammar¬†module. In¬†3.1¬†we define a grammar and show how to parse a simple sentence admitted by the grammar.

¬†grammar1 = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" S -> NP VP VP -> V NP | V NP PP PP -> P NP V -> "saw" | "ate" | "walked" NP -> "John" | "Mary" | "Bob" | Det N | Det N PP Det -> "a" | "an" | "the" | "my" N -> "man" | "dog" | "cat" | "telescope" | "park" P -> "in" | "on" | "by" | "with" """)¬†>>> sent = "Mary saw Bob".split() >>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> for tree in rd_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP Bob)))

Example 3.1 (code_cfg1.py):¬†Figure 3.1: A Simple Context-Free Grammar

The grammar in¬†3.1¬†contains productions involving various syntactic categories, as laid out in¬†3.1.

Table 3.1:

A production like¬†VP -> V NP | V NP PP¬†has a disjunction on the righthand side, shown by the¬†|¬†and is an abbreviation for the two productions¬†VP -> V NP¬†and¬†VP -> V NP PP.

Ôøº

Figure 3.2: Recursive Descent Parser Demo: This tool allows you to watch the operation of a recursive descent parser as it grows the parse tree and matches it against the input words.

Note

Your Turn:¬†Try developing a simple grammar of your own, using the recursive descent parser application,¬†nltk.app.rdparser(), shown in¬†3.2. It comes already loaded with a sample grammar, but you can edit this as you please (using the¬†Edit¬†menu). Change the grammar, and the sentence to be parsed, and run the parser using the¬†autostep¬†button.

If we parse the sentence¬†The dog saw a man in the park¬†using the grammar shown in¬†3.1, we end up with two trees, similar to those we saw for¬†(3b):

(9)

a.Ôøº

b.Ôøº

Since our grammar licenses two trees for this sentence, the sentence is said to be¬†structurally ambiguous. The ambiguity in question is called a¬†prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity, as we saw earlier in this chapter. As you may recall, it is an ambiguity about attachment since the¬†PP¬†in the park¬†needs to be attached to one of two places in the tree: either as a child of¬†VP¬†or else as a child of¬†NP. When the¬†PP¬†is attached to¬†VP, the intended interpretation is that the seeing event happened in the park. However, if the¬†PP¬†is attached to¬†NP, then it was the man who was in the park, and the agent of the seeing (the dog) might have been sitting on the balcony of an apartment overlooking the park.

3.2¬†¬†¬†Writing Your Own Grammars

If you are interested in experimenting with writing CFGs, you will find it helpful to create and edit your grammar in a text file, say¬†mygrammar.cfg. You can then load it into NLTK and parse with it as follows:

¬†>>> grammar1 = nltk.data.load('file:mygrammar.cfg') >>> sent = "Mary saw Bob".split() >>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> for tree in rd_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree)

Make sure that you put a¬†.cfg¬†suffix on the filename, and that there are no spaces in the string¬†'file:mygrammar.cfg'. If the command¬†print(tree)¬†produces no output, this is probably because your sentence¬†sent¬†is not admitted by your grammar. In this case, call the parser with tracing set to be on:¬†rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1, trace=2). You can also check what productions are currently in the grammar with the command¬†for¬†p¬†in¬†grammar1.productions():¬†print(p).

When you write CFGs for parsing in NLTK, you cannot combine grammatical categories with lexical items on the righthand side of the same production. Thus, a production such as¬†PP ->¬†'of'¬†NP¬†is disallowed. In addition, you are not permitted to place multi-word lexical items on the righthand side of a production. So rather than writing¬†NP ->¬†'New¬†York', you have to resort to something like¬†NP ->¬†'New_York'¬†instead.

3.3¬†¬†¬†Recursion in Syntactic Structure

A grammar is said to be¬†recursive¬†if a category occurring on the left hand side of a production also appears on the righthand side of a production, as illustrated in¬†3.3. The production¬†Nom -> Adj Nom¬†(where¬†Nom¬†is the category of nominals) involves direct recursion on the category¬†Nom, whereas indirect recursion on¬†S¬†arises from the combination of two productions, namely¬†S -> NP VP¬†and¬†VP -> V S.

¬†grammar2 = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" S -> NP VP NP -> Det Nom | PropN Nom -> Adj Nom | N VP -> V Adj | V NP | V S | V NP PP PP -> P NP PropN -> 'Buster' | 'Chatterer' | 'Joe' Det -> 'the' | 'a' N -> 'bear' | 'squirrel' | 'tree' | 'fish' | 'log' Adj -> 'angry' | 'frightened' | 'little' | 'tall' V -> 'chased' | 'saw' | 'said' | 'thought' | 'was' | 'put' P -> 'on' """)

Example 3.3 (code_cfg2.py):¬†Figure 3.3: A Recursive Context-Free Grammar

To see how recursion arises from this grammar, consider the following trees.¬†(10a)¬†involves nested nominal phrases, while¬†(10b)¬†contains nested sentences.

(10)

a.Ôøº

b.Ôøº

We've only illustrated two levels of recursion here, but there's no upper limit on the depth. You can experiment with parsing sentences that involve more deeply nested structures. Beware that the¬†RecursiveDescentParser¬†is unable to handle¬†left-recursive¬†productions of the form¬†X -> X Y; we will return to this in¬†4.

4¬†¬†¬†Parsing With Context Free Grammar

A¬†parser¬†processes input sentences according to the productions of a grammar, and builds one or more constituent structures that conform to the grammar. A grammar is a declarative specification of well-formedness ‚Äî it is actually just a string, not a program. A parser is a procedural interpretation of the grammar. It searches through the space of trees licensed by a grammar to find one that has the required sentence along its fringe.

A parser permits a grammar to be evaluated against a collection of test sentences, helping linguists to discover mistakes in their grammatical analysis. A parser can serve as a model of psycholinguistic processing, helping to explain the difficulties that humans have with processing certain syntactic constructions. Many natural language applications involve parsing at some point; for example, we would expect the natural language questions submitted to a question-answering system to undergo parsing as an initial step.

In this section we see two simple parsing algorithms, a top-down method called recursive descent parsing, and a bottom-up method called shift-reduce parsing. We also see some more sophisticated algorithms, a top-down method with bottom-up filtering called left-corner parsing, and a dynamic programming technique called chart parsing.

4.1¬†¬†¬†Recursive Descent Parsing

The simplest kind of parser interprets a grammar as a specification of how to break a high-level goal into several lower-level subgoals. The top-level goal is to find an¬†S. The¬†S¬†‚Üí¬†NP VP¬†production permits the parser to replace this goal with two subgoals: find an¬†NP, then find a¬†VP. Each of these subgoals can be replaced in turn by sub-sub-goals, using productions that have¬†NP¬†and¬†VP¬†on their left-hand side. Eventually, this expansion process leads to subgoals such as: find the word¬†telescope. Such subgoals can be directly compared against the input sequence, and succeed if the next word is matched. If there is no match the parser must back up and try a different alternative.

The recursive descent parser builds a parse tree during the above process. With the initial goal (find an¬†S), the¬†S¬†root node is created. As the above process recursively expands its goals using the productions of the grammar, the parse tree is extended downwards (hence the name¬†recursive descent). We can see this in action using the graphical demonstration¬†nltk.app.rdparser(). Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in¬†4.1.

Ôøº

Figure 4.1: Six Stages of a Recursive Descent Parser: the parser begins with a tree consisting of the node¬†S; at each stage it consults the grammar to find a production that can be used to enlarge the tree; when a lexical production is encountered, its word is compared against the input; after a complete parse has been found, the parser backtracks to look for more parses.

During this process, the parser is often forced to choose between several possible productions. For example, in going from step 3 to step 4, it tries to find productions with¬†N¬†on the left-hand side. The first of these is¬†N¬†‚Üí¬†man. When this does not work it¬†backtracks, and tries other¬†N¬†productions in order, until it gets to¬†N¬†‚Üí¬†dog, which matches the next word in the input sentence. Much later, as shown in step 5, it finds a complete parse. This is a tree that covers the entire sentence, without any dangling edges. Once a parse has been found, we can get the parser to look for additional parses. Again it will backtrack and explore other choices of production in case any of them result in a parse.

NLTK provides a recursive descent parser:

¬†>>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> sent = 'Mary saw a dog'.split() >>> for tree in rd_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog))))

Note

RecursiveDescentParser()¬†takes an optional parameter¬†trace. If¬†trace¬†is greater than zero, then the parser will report the steps that it takes as it parses a text.

Recursive descent parsing has three key shortcomings. First, left-recursive productions like¬†NP -> NP PP¬†send it into an infinite loop. Second, the parser wastes a lot of time considering words and structures that do not correspond to the input sentence. Third, the backtracking process may discard parsed constituents that will need to be rebuilt again later. For example, backtracking over¬†VP -> V NP¬†will discard the subtree created for the¬†NP. If the parser then proceeds with¬†VP -> V NP PP, then the¬†NP¬†subtree must be created all over again.

Recursive descent parsing is a kind of¬†top-down parsing. Top-down parsers use a grammar to¬†predict¬†what the input will be, before inspecting the input! However, since the input is available to the parser all along, it would be more sensible to consider the input sentence from the very beginning. This approach is called¬†bottom-up parsing, and we will see an example in the next section.

4.2¬†¬†¬†Shift-Reduce Parsing

A simple kind of bottom-up parser is the¬†shift-reduce parser. In common with all bottom-up parsers, a shift-reduce parser tries to find sequences of words and phrases that correspond to the¬†right hand¬†side of a grammar production, and replace them with the left-hand side, until the whole sentence is reduced to an¬†S.

The shift-reduce parser repeatedly pushes the next input word onto a stack (4.1); this is the¬†shift¬†operation. If the top¬†n¬†items on the stack match the¬†n¬†items on the right hand side of some production, then they are all popped off the stack, and the item on the left-hand side of the production is pushed on the stack. This replacement of the top¬†n¬†items with a single item is the¬†reduce¬†operation. This operation may only be applied to the top of the stack; reducing items lower in the stack must be done before later items are pushed onto the stack. The parser finishes when all the input is consumed and there is only one item remaining on the stack, a parse tree with an¬†S¬†node as its root. The shift-reduce parser builds a parse tree during the above process. Each time it pops¬†n¬†items off the stack it combines them into a partial parse tree, and pushes this back on the stack. We can see the shift-reduce parsing algorithm in action using the graphical demonstration¬†nltk.app.srparser(). Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in¬†4.2.

Ôøº

Figure 4.2: Six Stages of a Shift-Reduce Parser: the parser begins by shifting the first input word onto its stack; once the top items on the stack match the right hand side of a grammar production, they can be replaced with the left hand side of that production; the parser succeeds once all input is consumed and one¬†S¬†item remains on the stack.

NLTK provides¬†ShiftReduceParser(), a simple implementation of a shift-reduce parser. This parser does not implement any backtracking, so it is not guaranteed to find a parse for a text, even if one exists. Furthermore, it will only find at most one parse, even if more parses exist. We can provide an optional¬†trace¬†parameter that controls how verbosely the parser reports the steps that it takes as it parses a text:

¬†>>> sr_parser = nltk.ShiftReduceParser(grammar1) >>> sent = 'Mary saw a dog'.split() >>> for tree in sr_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog))))

Note

Your Turn:¬†Run the above parser in tracing mode to see the sequence of shift and reduce operations, using¬†sr_parse = nltk.ShiftReduceParser(grammar1, trace=2)

A shift-reduce parser can reach a dead end and fail to find any parse, even if the input sentence is well-formed according to the grammar. When this happens, no input remains, and the stack contains items which cannot be reduced to an¬†S. The problem arises because there are choices made earlier that cannot be undone by the parser (although users of the graphical demonstration can undo their choices). There are two kinds of choices to be made by the parser: (a) which reduction to do when more than one is possible (b) whether to shift or reduce when either action is possible.

A shift-reduce parser may be extended to implement policies for resolving such conflicts. For example, it may address shift-reduce conflicts by shifting only when no reductions are possible, and it may address reduce-reduce conflicts by favoring the reduction operation that removes the most items from the stack. (A generalization of shift-reduce parser, a "lookahead LR parser", is commonly used in programming language compilers.)

The advantage of shift-reduce parsers over recursive descent parsers is that they only build structure that corresponds to the words in the input. Furthermore, they only build each sub-structure once, e.g.¬†NP(Det(the), N(man))¬†is only built and pushed onto the stack a single time, regardless of whether it will later be used by the¬†VP -> V NP PP¬†reduction or the¬†NP -> NP PP¬†reduction.

4.3¬†¬†¬†The Left-Corner Parser

One of the problems with the recursive descent parser is that it goes into an infinite loop when it encounters a left-recursive production. This is because it applies the grammar productions blindly, without considering the actual input sentence. A left-corner parser is a hybrid between the bottom-up and top-down approaches we have seen.

Grammar¬†grammar1¬†allows us to produce the following parse of¬†John saw Mary:

(11)Ôøº

Recall that the grammar (defined in¬†3.3) has the following productions for expanding¬†NP:

(12)

a.NP -> Det N

b.NP -> Det N PP

c.NP ->¬†"John"¬†|¬†"Mary"¬†|¬†"Bob"

Suppose we ask you to first look at tree¬†(11), and then decide which of the¬†NP¬†productions you'd want a recursive descent parser to apply first ‚Äî obviously,¬†(12c)¬†is the right choice! How do you know that it would be pointless to apply¬†(12a)¬†or¬†(12b)¬†instead? Because neither of these productions will derive a sequence whose first word is¬†John. That is, we can easily tell that in a successful parse of¬†John saw Mary, the parser has to expand¬†NP¬†in such a way that¬†NP¬†derives the sequence¬†John¬†Œ±. More generally, we say that a category¬†B¬†is a¬†left-corner¬†of a tree rooted in¬†A¬†if¬†A¬†‚áí*¬†B¬†Œ±.

(13)Ôøº

A¬†left-corner parser¬†is a top-down parser with bottom-up filtering. Unlike an ordinary recursive descent parser, it does not get trapped in left recursive productions. Before starting its work, a left-corner parser preprocesses the context-free grammar to build a table where each row contains two cells, the first holding a non-terminal, and the second holding the collection of possible left corners of that non-terminal.¬†4.1¬†illustrates this for the grammar from¬†grammar2.

Table 4.1:

Left-Corners in¬†grammar2

CategoryLeft-Corners (pre-terminals)SNPNPDet, PropNVPVPPP

Each time a production is considered by the parser, it checks that the next input word is compatible with at least one of the pre-terminal categories in the left-corner table.

4.4¬†¬†¬†Well-Formed Substring Tables

The simple parsers discussed above suffer from limitations in both completeness and efficiency. In order to remedy these, we will apply the algorithm design technique of¬†dynamic programming¬†to the parsing problem. As we saw in¬†4.7, dynamic programming stores intermediate results and re-uses them when appropriate, achieving significant efficiency gains. This technique can be applied to syntactic parsing, allowing us to store partial solutions to the parsing task and then look them up as necessary in order to efficiently arrive at a complete solution. This approach to parsing is known as¬†chart parsing. We introduce the main idea in this section; see the online materials available for this chapter for more implementation details.

Dynamic programming allows us to build the¬†PP¬†in my pajamas¬†just once. The first time we build it we save it in a table, then we look it up when we need to use it as a subconstituent of either the object¬†NP¬†or the higher¬†VP. This table is known as a¬†well-formed substring table, or WFST for short. (The term "substring" refers to a contiguous sequence of words within a sentence.) We will show how to construct the WFST bottom-up so as to systematically record what syntactic constituents have been found.

Let's set our input to be the sentence in¬†(2). The numerically specified spans of the WFST are reminiscent of Python's slice notation (3.2). Another way to think about the data structure is shown in¬†4.3, a data structure known as a¬†chart.

Ôøº

Figure 4.3: The Chart Data Structure: words are the edge labels of a linear graph structure.

In a WFST, we record the position of the words by filling in cells in a triangular matrix: the vertical axis will denote the start position of a substring, while the horizontal axis will denote the end position (thus¬†shot¬†will appear in the cell with coordinates (1, 2)). To simplify this presentation, we will assume each word has a unique lexical category, and we will store this (not the word) in the matrix. So cell (1, 2) will contain the entry¬†V. More generally, if our input string is¬†a0a1¬†...¬†an, and our grammar contains a production of the form¬†A¬†‚Üí¬†ai, then we add¬†A¬†to the cell (i,¬†`i`+1).

System Message: WARNING/2 (ch08.rst2, line 900);¬†backlink

Inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end-string.

So, for every word in¬†text, we can look up in our grammar what category it belongs to.

¬†>>> text = ['I', 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas'] >>> groucho_grammar.productions(rhs=text[1]) [V -> 'shot']

For our WFST, we create an¬†(n-1)¬†√ó¬†(n-1)¬†matrix as a list of lists in Python, and initialize it with the lexical categories of each token, in the¬†init_wfst()¬†function in¬†4.4. We also define a utility function¬†display()¬†to pretty-print the WFST for us. As expected, there is a¬†V¬†in cell (1, 2).

¬†def init_wfst(tokens, grammar): numtokens = len(tokens) wfst = [[None for i in range(numtokens+1)] for j in range(numtokens+1)] for i in range(numtokens): productions = grammar.productions(rhs=tokens[i]) wfst[i][i+1] = productions[0].lhs() return wfst def complete_wfst(wfst, tokens, grammar, trace=False): index = dict((p.rhs(), p.lhs()) for p in grammar.productions()) numtokens = len(tokens) for span in range(2, numtokens+1): for start in range(numtokens+1-span): end = start + span for mid in range(start+1, end): nt1, nt2 = wfst[start][mid], wfst[mid][end] if nt1 and nt2 and (nt1,nt2) in index: wfst[start][end] = index[(nt1,nt2)] if trace: print("[%s] %3s [%s] %3s [%s] ==> [%s] %3s [%s]" % \ (start, nt1, mid, nt2, end, start, index[(nt1,nt2)], end)) return wfst def display(wfst, tokens): print('\nWFST ' + ' '.join(("%-4d" % i) for i in range(1, len(wfst)))) for i in range(len(wfst)-1): print("%d " % i, end=" ") for j in range(1, len(wfst)): print("%-4s" % (wfst[i][j] or '.'), end=" ") print() >>> tokens = "I shot an elephant in my pajamas".split() >>> wfst0 = init_wfst(tokens, groucho_grammar) >>> display(wfst0, tokens) WFST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 NP . . . . . . 1 .

Example 4.4 (code_wfst.py):¬†Figure 4.4: Acceptor Using Well-Formed Substring Table

Returning to our tabular representation, given that we have¬†Det¬†in cell (2, 3) for the word¬†an, and¬†N¬†in cell (3, 4) for the word¬†elephant, what should we put into cell (2, 4) for¬†an elephant? We need to find a production of the form¬†A¬†‚Üí¬†Det N. Consulting the grammar, we know that we can enter¬†NP¬†in cell (2, 4).

More generally, we can enter¬†A¬†in¬†(i, j)¬†if there is a production¬†A¬†‚Üí¬†B¬†C, and we find nonterminal¬†B¬†in¬†(i, k)¬†and¬†C¬†in¬†(k, j). The program in¬†4.4¬†uses this rule to complete the WFST. By setting¬†trace¬†to¬†True¬†when calling the function¬†complete_wfst(), we see tracing output that shows the WFST being constructed:

¬†>>> wfst1 = complete_wfst(wfst0, tokens, groucho_grammar, trace=True) [2] Det [3] N [4] ==> [2] NP [4] [5] Det [6] N [7] ==> [5] NP [7] [1] V [2] NP [4] ==> [1] VP [4] [4] P [5] NP [7] ==> [4] PP [7] [0] NP [1] VP [4] ==> [0] S [4] [1] VP [4] PP [7] ==> [1] VP [7] [0] NP [1] VP [7] ==> [0] S [7]

For example, this says that since we found¬†Det¬†at¬†wfst[2][3]¬†and¬†N¬†at¬†wfst[3][4], we can add¬†NP¬†to¬†wfst[2][4].

Note

To help us easily retrieve productions by their right hand sides, we create an index for the grammar. This is an example of a space-time trade-off: we do a reverse lookup on the grammar, instead of having to check through the entire list of productions each time we want to look up via the right hand side.

Ôøº

Figure 4.5: The Chart Data Structure: non-terminals are represented as extra edges in the chart.

We conclude that there is a parse for the whole input string once we have constructed an¬†S¬†node in cell (0, 7), showing that we have found a sentence that covers the whole input. The final state of the WFST is depicted in¬†4.5.

Notice that we have not used any built-in parsing functions here. We've implemented a complete, primitive chart parser from the ground up!

WFST's have several shortcomings. First, as you can see, the WFST is not itself a parse tree, so the technique is strictly speaking¬†recognizing¬†that a sentence is admitted by a grammar, rather than parsing it. Second, it requires every non-lexical grammar production to be¬†binary. Although it is possible to convert an arbitrary CFG into this form, we would prefer to use an approach without such a requirement. Third, as a bottom-up approach it is potentially wasteful, being able to propose constituents in locations that would not be licensed by the grammar.

Finally, the WFST did not represent the structural ambiguity in the sentence (i.e. the two verb phrase readings). The¬†VP¬†in cell (1, 7) was actually entered twice, once for a¬†V NP¬†reading, and once for a¬†VP PP¬†reading. These are different hypotheses, and the second overwrote the first (as it happens this didn't matter since the left hand side was the same.) Chart parsers use a slighly richer data structure and some interesting algorithms to solve these problems (see the Further Reading section at the end of this chapter for details).

5¬†¬†¬†Dependencies and Dependency Grammar

Phrase structure grammar is concerned with how words and sequences of words¬†combine¬†to form constituents. A distinct and complementary approach, dependency grammar, focusses instead on how words¬†relate¬†to other words. Dependency is a binary asymmetric relation that holds between a¬†head¬†and its¬†dependents. The head of a sentence is usually taken to be the tensed verb, and every other word is either dependent on the sentence head, or connects to it through a path of dependencies.

A dependency representation is a labeled directed graph, where the nodes are the lexical items and the labeled arcs represent dependency relations from heads to dependents.¬†5.1¬†illustrates a dependency graph, where arrows point from heads to their dependents.

Ôøº

Figure 5.1: Dependency Structure: arrows point from heads to their dependents; labels indicate the grammatical function of the dependent as subject, object or modifier.

The arcs in¬†5.1¬†are labeled with the grammatical function that holds between a dependent and its head. For example,¬†I¬†is the¬†SBJ¬†(subject) of¬†shot¬†(which is the head of the whole sentence), and¬†in¬†is an¬†NMOD¬†(noun modifier of¬†elephant). In contrast to phrase structure grammar, therefore, dependency grammars can be used to directly express grammatical functions as a type of dependency.

Here's one way of encoding a dependency grammar in NLTK ‚Äî note that it only captures bare dependency information without specifying the type of dependency:

¬†>>> groucho_dep_grammar = nltk.DependencyGrammar.fromstring(""" ... 'shot' -> 'I' | 'elephant' | 'in' ... 'elephant' -> 'an' | 'in' ... 'in' -> 'pajamas' ... 'pajamas' -> 'my' ... """) >>> print(groucho_dep_grammar) Dependency grammar with 7 productions 'shot' -> 'I' 'shot' -> 'elephant' 'shot' -> 'in' 'elephant' -> 'an' 'elephant' -> 'in' 'in' -> 'pajamas' 'pajamas' -> 'my'

A dependency graph is¬†projective¬†if, when all the words are written in linear order, the edges can be drawn above the words without crossing. This is equivalent to saying that a word and all its descendents (dependents and dependents of its dependents, etc.) form a contiguous sequence of words within the sentence.¬†5.1¬†is projective, and we can parse many sentences in English using a projective dependency parser. The next example shows how¬†groucho_dep_grammar¬†provides an alternative approach to capturing the attachment ambiguity that we examined earlier with phrase structure grammar.

¬†>>> pdp = nltk.ProjectiveDependencyParser(groucho_dep_grammar) >>> sent = 'I shot an elephant in my pajamas'.split() >>> trees = pdp.parse(sent) >>> for tree in trees: ... print(tree) (shot I (elephant an (in (pajamas my)))) (shot I (elephant an) (in (pajamas my)))

These bracketed dependency structures can also be displayed as trees, where dependents are shown as children of their heads.

(14)ÔøºÔøº

In languages with more flexible word order than English, non-projective dependencies are more frequent.

Various criteria have been proposed for deciding what is the head¬†H¬†and what is the dependent¬†D¬†in a construction¬†C. Some of the most important are the following:

H¬†determines the distribution class of¬†C; or alternatively, the external syntactic properties of¬†C¬†are due to¬†H.

H¬†determines the semantic type of¬†C.

H¬†is obligatory while¬†D¬†may be optional.

H¬†selects¬†D¬†and determines whether it is obligatory or optional.

The morphological form of¬†D¬†is determined by¬†H¬†(e.g. agreement or case government).

When we say in a phrase structure grammar that the immediate constituents of a¬†PP¬†are¬†P¬†and¬†NP, we are implicitly appealing to the head / dependent distinction. A prepositional phrase is a phrase whose head is a preposition; moreover, the¬†NP¬†is a dependent of¬†P. The same distinction carries over to the other types of phrase that we have discussed. The key point to note here is that although phrase structure grammars seem very different from dependency grammars, they implicitly embody a recognition of dependency relations. While CFGs are not intended to directly capture dependencies, more recent linguistic frameworks have increasingly adopted formalisms which combine aspects of both approaches.

5.1¬†¬†¬†Valency and the Lexicon

Let us take a closer look at verbs and their dependents. The grammar in¬†3.3¬†correctly generates examples like¬†(15d).

(15)

a.The squirrel was frightened.

b.Chatterer saw the bear.

c.Chatterer thought Buster was angry.

d.Joe put the fish on the log.

These possibilities correspond to the following productions:

Table 5.1:

VP productions and their lexical heads

VP -> V AdjwasVP -> V NPsawVP -> V SthoughtVP -> V NP PPput

That is,¬†was¬†can occur with a following¬†Adj,¬†saw¬†can occur with a following¬†NP,¬†thought¬†can occur with a following¬†S¬†and¬†put¬†can occur with a following¬†NP¬†and¬†PP. The dependents¬†Adj,¬†NP,¬†PP¬†and¬†S¬†are often called¬†complements¬†of the respective verbs and there are strong constraints on what verbs can occur with what complements. By contrast with¬†(15d), the word sequences in¬†(16d)¬†are ill-formed:

(16)

a.*The squirrel was Buster was angry.

b.*Chatterer saw frightened.

c.*Chatterer thought the bear.

d.*Joe put on the log.

Note

With a little imagination, it is possible to invent contexts in which unusual combinations of verbs and complements are interpretable. However, we assume that the above examples are to be interpreted in neutral contexts.

In the tradition of dependency grammar, the verbs in¬†5.1¬†are said to have different¬†valencies. Valency restrictions are not just applicable to verbs, but also to the other classes of heads.

Within frameworks based on phrase structure grammar, various techniques have been proposed for excluding the ungrammatical examples in¬†(16d). In a CFG, we need some way of constraining grammar productions which expand¬†VP¬†so that verbs¬†only¬†co-occur with their correct complements. We can do this by dividing the class of verbs into "subcategories", each of which is associated with a different set of complements. For example,¬†transitive verbs¬†such as¬†chased¬†and¬†saw¬†require a following¬†NP¬†object complement; that is, they are¬†subcategorized¬†for¬†NP¬†direct objects. If we introduce a new category label for transitive verbs, namely¬†TV¬†(for Transitive Verb), then we can use it in the following productions:

VP -> TV NP TV -> 'chased' | 'saw' 

Now¬†*Joe thought the bear¬†is excluded since we haven't listed¬†thought¬†as a¬†TV, but¬†Chatterer saw the bear¬†is still allowed.¬†5.2¬†provides more examples of labels for verb subcategories.

Table 5.2:

Verb Subcategories

SymbolMeaningExampleIVintransitive verbbarkedTVtransitive verbsaw a manDatVdative verbgave a dog to a manSVsentential verbsaid that a dog barked

Valency is a property of lexical items, and we will discuss it further in¬†9..

Complements are often contrasted with modifiers (or adjuncts), although both are kinds of dependent. Prepositional phrases, adjectives and adverbs typically function as modifiers. Unlike complements, modifiers are optional, can often be iterated, and are not selected for by heads in the same way as complements. For example, the adverb¬†really¬†can be added as a modifer to all the sentence in¬†(17d):

(17)

a.The squirrel really was frightened.

b.Chatterer really saw the bear.

c.Chatterer really thought Buster was angry.

d.Joe really put the fish on the log.

The structural ambiguity of¬†PP¬†attachment, which we have illustrated in both phrase structure and dependency grammars, corresponds semantically to an ambiguity in the scope of the modifier.

5.2¬†¬†¬†Scaling Up

So far, we have only considered "toy grammars," small grammars that illustrate the key aspects of parsing. But there is an obvious question as to whether the approach can be scaled up to cover large corpora of natural languages. How hard would it be to construct such a set of productions by hand? In general, the answer is:¬†very hard. Even if we allow ourselves to use various formal devices that give much more succinct representations of grammar productions, it is still extremely difficult to keep control of the complex interactions between the many productions required to cover the major constructions of a language. In other words, it is hard to modularize grammars so that one portion can be developed independently of the other parts. This in turn means that it is difficult to distribute the task of grammar writing across a team of linguists. Another difficulty is that as the grammar expands to cover a wider and wider range of constructions, there is a corresponding increase in the number of analyses which are admitted for any one sentence. In other words, ambiguity increases with coverage.

Despite these problems, some large collaborative projects have achieved interesting and impressive results in developing rule-based grammars for several languages. Examples are the Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) Pargram project, the Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) LinGO Matrix framework, and the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar XTAG Project.

6¬†¬†¬†Grammar Development

Parsing builds trees over sentences, according to a phrase structure grammar. Now, all the examples we gave above only involved toy grammars containing a handful of productions. What happens if we try to scale up this approach to deal with realistic corpora of language? In this section we will see how to access treebanks, and look at the challenge of developing broad-coverage grammars.

6.1¬†¬†¬†Treebanks and Grammars

The¬†corpus¬†module defines the¬†treebank¬†corpus reader, which contains a 10% sample of the Penn Treebank corpus.

¬†>>> from nltk.corpus import treebank >>> t = treebank.parsed_sents('wsj_0001.mrg')[0] >>> print(t) (S (NP-SBJ (NP (NNP Pierre) (NNP Vinken)) (, ,) (ADJP (NP (CD 61) (NNS years)) (JJ old)) (, ,)) (VP (MD will) (VP (VB join) (NP (DT the) (NN board)) (PP-CLR (IN as) (NP (DT a) (JJ nonexecutive) (NN director))) (NP-TMP (NNP Nov.) (CD 29)))) (. .))

We can use this data to help develop a grammar. For example, the program in¬†6.1¬†uses a simple filter to find verbs that take sentential complements. Assuming we already have a production of the form¬†VP -> Vs S, this information enables us to identify particular verbs that would be included in the expansion of¬†Vs.

¬†def filter(tree): child_nodes = [child.label() for child in tree if isinstance(child, nltk.Tree)] return (tree.label() == 'VP') and ('S' in child_nodes)¬†>>> from nltk.corpus import treebank >>> [subtree for tree in treebank.parsed_sents() ... for subtree in tree.subtrees(filter)] [Tree('VP', [Tree('VBN', ['named']), Tree('S', [Tree('NP-SBJ', ...]), ...]), ...]

Example 6.1 (code_sentential_complement.py):¬†Figure 6.1: Searching a Treebank to find Sentential Complements

The Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus,¬†nltk.corpus.ppattach¬†is another source of information about the valency of particular verbs. Here we illustrate a technique for mining this corpus. It finds pairs of prepositional phrases where the preposition and noun are fixed, but where the choice of verb determines whether the prepositional phrase is attached to the¬†VP¬†or to the¬†NP.

¬†>>> from collections import defaultdict >>> entries = nltk.corpus.ppattach.attachments('training') >>> table = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(set)) >>> for entry in entries: ... key = entry.noun1 + '-' + entry.prep + '-' + entry.noun2 ... table[key][entry.attachment].add(entry.verb) ... >>> for key in sorted(table): ... if len(table[key]) > 1: ... print(key, 'N:', sorted(table[key]['N']), 'V:', sorted(table[key]['V']))

Amongst the output lines of this program we find¬†offer-from-group N: ['rejected'] V: ['received'], which indicates that¬†received¬†expects a separate¬†PP¬†complement attached to the¬†VP, while¬†rejected¬†does not. As before, we can use this information to help construct the grammar.

The NLTK corpus collection includes data from the PE08 Cross-Framework and Cross Domain Parser Evaluation Shared Task. A collection of larger grammars has been prepared for the purpose of comparing different parsers, which can be obtained by downloading the¬†large_grammars¬†package (e.g.¬†python -m nltk.downloader large_grammars).

The NLTK corpus collection also includes a sample from the¬†Sinica Treebank Corpus, consisting of 10,000 parsed sentences drawn from the¬†Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese. Let's load and display one of the trees in this corpus.

¬†>>> nltk.corpus.sinica_treebank.parsed_sents()[3450].draw() 

Ôøº

6.2¬†¬†¬†Pernicious Ambiguity

Unfortunately, as the coverage of the grammar increases and the length of the input sentences grows, the number of parse trees grows rapidly. In fact, it grows at an astronomical rate.

Let's explore this issue with the help of a simple example. The word¬†fish¬†is both a noun and a verb. We can make up the sentence¬†fish fish fish, meaning¬†fish like to fish for other fish. (Try this with¬†police¬†if you prefer something more sensible.) Here is a toy grammar for the "fish" sentences.

¬†>>> grammar = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" ... S -> NP V NP ... NP -> NP Sbar ... Sbar -> NP V ... NP -> 'fish' ... V -> 'fish' ... """)

Now we can try parsing a longer sentence,¬†fish fish fish fish fish, which amongst other things, means 'fish that other fish fish are in the habit of fishing fish themselves'. We use the NLTK chart parser, which was mentioned earlier in this chapter. This sentence has two readings.

¬†>>> tokens = ["fish"] * 5 >>> cp = nltk.ChartParser(grammar) >>> for tree in cp.parse(tokens): ... print(tree) (S (NP fish) (V fish) (NP (NP fish) (Sbar (NP fish) (V fish)))) (S (NP (NP fish) (Sbar (NP fish) (V fish))) (V fish) (NP fish))

As the length of this sentence goes up (3, 5, 7, ...) we get the following numbers of parse trees: 1; 2; 5; 14; 42; 132; 429; 1,430; 4,862; 16,796; 58,786; 208,012; ... (These are the¬†Catalan numbers, which we saw in an exercise in¬†4). The last of these is for a sentence of length 23, the average length of sentences in the WSJ section of Penn Treebank. For a sentence of length 50 there would be over 1012¬†parses, and this is only half the length of the Piglet sentence (1), which young children process effortlessly. No practical NLP system could construct millions of trees for a sentence and choose the appropriate one in the context. It's clear that humans don't do this either!

Note that the problem is not with our choice of example.¬†(Church & Patil, 1982)¬†point out that the syntactic ambiguity of¬†PP¬†attachment in sentences like¬†(18)¬†also grows in proportion to the Catalan numbers.

(18)Put the block in the box on the table.

So much for structural ambiguity; what about lexical ambiguity? As soon as we try to construct a broad-coverage grammar, we are forced to make lexical entries highly ambiguous for their part of speech. In a toy grammar,¬†a¬†is only a determiner,¬†dog¬†is only a noun, and¬†runs¬†is only a verb. However, in a broad-coverage grammar,¬†a¬†is also a noun (e.g.¬†part a),¬†dog¬†is also a verb (meaning to follow closely), and¬†runs¬†is also a noun (e.g.¬†ski runs). In fact, all words can be referred to by name: e.g.¬†the verb 'ate' is spelled with three letters; in speech we do not need to supply quotation marks. Furthermore, it is possible to¬†verb¬†most nouns. Thus a parser for a broad-coverage grammar will be overwhelmed with ambiguity. Even complete gibberish will often have a reading, e.g.¬†the a are of I. As¬†(Klavans & Resnik, 1996)¬†has pointed out, this is not word salad but a grammatical noun phrase, in which¬†are¬†is a noun meaning a hundredth of a hectare (or 100 sq m), and¬†a¬†and¬†I¬†are nouns designating coordinates, as shown in¬†6.2.

Ôøº

Figure 6.2: "The a are of I": a schematic drawing of 27 paddocks, each being one "are" in size, and each identified using coordinates; the top left cell is the¬†a¬†"are" of column¬†I¬†(after Abney).

Even though this phrase is unlikely, it is still grammatical and a broad-coverage parser should be able to construct a parse tree for it. Similarly, sentences that seem to be unambiguous, such as¬†John saw Mary, turn out to have other readings we would not have anticipated (as Abney explains). This ambiguity is unavoidable, and leads to horrendous inefficiency in parsing seemingly innocuous sentences. The solution to these problems is provided by¬†probabilistic parsing, which allows us to¬†rank¬†the parses of an ambiguous sentence on the basis of evidence from corpora.

6.3¬†¬†¬†Weighted Grammar

As we have just seen, dealing with ambiguity is a key challenge in developing broad coverage parsers. Chart parsers improve the efficiency of computing multiple parses of the same sentences, but they are still overwhelmed by the sheer number of possible parses. Weighted grammars and probabilistic parsing algorithms have provided an effective solution to these problems.

Before looking at these, we need to understand why the notion of grammaticality could be¬†gradient. Considering the verb¬†give. This verb requires both a direct object (the thing being given) and an indirect object (the recipient). These complements can be given in either order, as illustrated in¬†(19). In the "prepositional dative" form in¬†(19a), the direct object appears first, followed by a prepositional phrase containing the indirect object.

(19)

a.Kim gave a bone to the dog

b.Kim gave the dog a bone

In the "double object" form in¬†(19b), the indirect object appears first, followed by the direct object. In the above case, either order is acceptable. However, if the indirect object is a pronoun, there is a strong preference for the double object construction:

(20)

a.Kim gives the heebie-jeebies to me (*prepositional dative)

b.Kim gives me the heebie-jeebies (double object)

Using the Penn Treebank sample, we can examine all instances of prepositional dative and double object constructions involving¬†give, as shown in¬†6.3.

¬†def give(t): return t.label() == 'VP' and len(t) > 2 and t[1].label() == 'NP'\ and (t[2].label() == 'PP-DTV' or t[2].label() == 'NP')\ and ('give' in t[0].leaves() or 'gave' in t[0].leaves()) def sent(t): return ' '.join(token for token in t.leaves() if token[0] not in '*-0') def print_node(t, width): output = "%s %s: %s / %s: %s" %\ (sent(t[0]), t[1].label(), sent(t[1]), t[2].label(), sent(t[2])) if len(output) > width: output = output[:width] + "..." print(output)¬†>>> for tree in nltk.corpus.treebank.parsed_sents(): ... for t in tree.subtrees(give): ... print_node(t, 72) gave NP: the chefs / NP: a standing ovation give NP: advertisers / NP: discounts for maintaining or increasing ad sp... give NP: it / PP-DTV: to the politicians gave NP: them / NP: similar help give NP: them / NP: give NP: only French history questions / PP-DTV: to students in a Europe... give NP: federal judges / NP: a raise give NP: consumers / NP: the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis gave NP: Mitsui / NP: access to a high-tech medical product give NP: Mitsubishi / NP: a window on the U.S. glass industry give NP: much thought / PP-DTV: to the rates she was receiving , nor to ... give NP: your Foster Savings Institution / NP: the gift of hope and free... give NP: market operators / NP: the authority to suspend trading in futu... gave NP: quick approval / PP-DTV: to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appr... give NP: the Transportation Department / NP: up to 50 days to review any... give NP: the president / NP: such power give NP: me / NP: the heebie-jeebies give NP: holders / NP: the right , but not the obligation , to buy a cal... gave NP: Mr. Thomas / NP: only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than ``... give NP: the president / NP: line-item veto power

Example 6.3 (code_give.py):¬†Figure 6.3: Usage of Give and Gave in the Penn Treebank sample

We can observe a strong tendency for the shortest complement to appear first. However, this does not account for a form like¬†give NP: federal judges / NP: a raise, where animacy may play a role. In fact there turn out to be a large number of contributing factors, as surveyed by¬†(Bresnan & Hay, 2006). Such preferences can be represented in a weighted grammar.

A¬†probabilistic context free grammar¬†(or¬†PCFG) is a context free grammar that associates a probability with each of its productions. It generates the same set of parses for a text that the corresponding context free grammar does, and assigns a probability to each parse. The probability of a parse generated by a PCFG is simply the product of the probabilities of the productions used to generate it.

The simplest way to define a PCFG is to load it from a specially formatted string consisting of a sequence of weighted productions, where weights appear in brackets, as shown in¬†6.4.

¬†grammar = nltk.PCFG.fromstring(""" S -> NP VP [1.0] VP -> TV NP [0.4] VP -> IV [0.3] VP -> DatV NP NP [0.3] TV -> 'saw' [1.0] IV -> 'ate' [1.0] DatV -> 'gave' [1.0] NP -> 'telescopes' [0.8] NP -> 'Jack' [0.2] """)¬†>>> print(grammar) Grammar with 9 productions (start state = S) S -> NP VP [1.0] VP -> TV NP [0.4] VP -> IV [0.3] VP -> DatV NP NP [0.3] TV -> 'saw' [1.0] IV -> 'ate' [1.0] DatV -> 'gave' [1.0] NP -> 'telescopes' [0.8] NP -> 'Jack' [0.2]

Example 6.4 (code_pcfg1.py):¬†Figure 6.4: Defining a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG)

It is sometimes convenient to combine multiple productions into a single line, e.g.¬†VP -> TV NP [0.4] | IV [0.3] | DatV NP NP [0.3]. In order to ensure that the trees generated by the grammar form a probability distribution, PCFG grammars impose the constraint that all productions with a given left-hand side must have probabilities that sum to one. The grammar in¬†6.4¬†obeys this constraint: for¬†S, there is only one production, with a probability of 1.0; for¬†VP, 0.4+0.3+0.3=1.0; and for¬†NP, 0.8+0.2=1.0. The parse tree returned by¬†parse()¬†includes probabilities:

¬†>>> viterbi_parser = nltk.ViterbiParser(grammar) >>> for tree in viterbi_parser.parse(['Jack', 'saw', 'telescopes']): ... print(tree) (S (NP Jack) (VP (TV saw) (NP telescopes))) (p=0.064)

Now that parse trees are assigned probabilities, it no longer matters that there may be a huge number of possible parses for a given sentence. A parser will be responsible for finding the most likely parses.

7¬†¬†¬†Summary

Sentences have internal organization that can be represented using a tree. Notable features of constituent structure are: recursion, heads, complements and modifiers.

A grammar is a compact characterization of a potentially infinite set of sentences; we say that a tree is well-formed according to a grammar, or that a grammar licenses a tree.

A grammar is a formal model for describing whether a given phrase can be assigned a particular constituent or dependency structure.

Given a set of syntactic categories, a context-free grammar uses a set of productions to say how a phrase of some category¬†A¬†can be analyzed into a sequence of smaller parts Œ±1¬†... Œ±n.

A dependency grammar uses productions to specify what the dependents are of a given lexical head.

Syntactic ambiguity arises when one sentence has more than one syntactic analysis (e.g. prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity).

A parser is a procedure for finding one or more trees corresponding to a grammatically well-formed sentence.

A simple top-down parser is the recursive descent parser, which recursively expands the start symbol (usually¬†S) with the help of the grammar productions, and tries to match the input sentence. This parser cannot handle left-recursive productions (e.g., productions such as¬†NP -> NP PP). It is inefficient in the way it blindly expands categories without checking whether they are compatible with the input string, and in repeatedly expanding the same non-terminals and discarding the results.

A simple bottom-up parser is the shift-reduce parser, which shifts input onto a stack and tries to match the items at the top of the stack with the right hand side of grammar productions. This parser is not guaranteed to find a valid parse for the input even if one exists, and builds substructure without checking whether it is globally consistent with the grammar.

There are many introductory books on syntax.¬†(O'Grady et al, 2004)¬†is a general introduction to linguistics, while¬†(Radford, 1988)¬†provides a gentle introduction to transformational grammar, and can be recommended for its coverage of transformational approaches to unbounded dependency constructions. The most widely used term in linguistics for formal grammar is¬†generative grammar, though it has nothing to do with generation¬†(Chomsky, 1965). The framework of X-bar Syntax is due to¬†(Jacobs & Rosenbaum, 1970), and is explored at greater length in¬†(Jackendoff, 1977)¬†(The primes we use replace Chomsky's typographically more demanding horizontal bars.)

(Burton-Roberts, 1997)¬†is a practically oriented textbook on how to analyze constituency in English, with extensive exemplification and exercises.¬†(Huddleston & Pullum, 2002)¬†provides an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of syntactic phenomena in English.

Chapter 12 of¬†(Jurafsky & Martin, 2008)¬†covers formal grammars of English; Sections 13.1-3 cover simple parsing algorithms and techniques for dealing with ambiguity; Chapter 14 covers statistical parsing; Chapter 16 covers the Chomsky hierarchy and the formal complexity of natural language.¬†(Levin, 1993)¬†has categorized English verbs into fine-grained classes, according to their syntactic properties.

There are several ongoing efforts to build large-scale rule-based grammars, e.g. the LFG Pargram project¬†http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/nltt/pargram/, the HPSG LinGO Matrix framework¬†http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/¬†and the XTAG Project¬†http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/.

9¬†¬†¬†Exercises

‚òº Can you come up with grammatical sentences that have probably never been uttered before? (Take turns with a partner.) What does this tell you about human language?

‚òº Recall Strunk and White's prohibition against sentence-initial¬†however¬†used to mean "although". Do a web search for¬†however¬†used at the start of the sentence. How widely used is this construction?

‚òº Consider the sentence¬†Kim arrived or Dana left and everyone cheered. Write down the parenthesized forms to show the relative scope of¬†and¬†and¬†or. Generate tree structures corresponding to both of these interpretations.

‚òº The¬†Tree¬†class implements a variety of other useful methods. See the¬†Tree¬†help documentation for more details, i.e. import the Tree class and then type¬†help(Tree).

‚òº In this exercise you will manually construct some parse trees.

Write code to produce two trees, one for each reading of the phrase¬†old men and women

Encode any of the trees presented in this chapter as a labeled bracketing and use¬†nltk.Tree()¬†to check that it is well-formed. Now use¬†draw()¬†to display the tree.

As in (a) above, draw a tree for¬†The woman saw a man last Thursday.

‚òº Write a recursive function to traverse a tree and return the depth of the tree, such that a tree with a single node would have depth zero. (Hint: the depth of a subtree is the maximum depth of its children, plus one.)

‚òº Analyze the A.A. Milne sentence about Piglet, by underlining all of the sentences it contains then replacing these with¬†S¬†(e.g. the first sentence becomes¬†S¬†when:lx`¬†S). Draw a tree structure for this "compressed" sentence. What are the main syntactic constructions used for building such a long sentence?

‚òº In the recursive descent parser demo, experiment with changing the sentence to be parsed by selecting¬†Edit Text¬†in the¬†Edit¬†menu.

‚òº Can the grammar in¬†grammar1¬†be used to describe sentences that are more than 20 words in length?

‚òº Use the graphical chart-parser interface to experiment with different rule invocation strategies. Come up with your own strategy that you can execute manually using the graphical interface. Describe the steps, and report any efficiency improvements it has (e.g. in terms of the size of the resulting chart). Do these improvements depend on the structure of the grammar? What do you think of the prospects for significant performance boosts from cleverer rule invocation strategies?

‚òº With pen and paper, manually trace the execution of a recursive descent parser and a shift-reduce parser, for a CFG you have already seen, or one of your own devising.

‚òº We have seen that a chart parser adds but never removes edges from a chart. Why?

‚òº Consider the sequence of words:¬†Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo. This is a grammatically correct sentence, as explained at¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo.¬†Consider the tree diagram presented on this Wikipedia page, and write down a suitable grammar. Normalize case to lowercase, to simulate the problem that a listener has when hearing this sentence. Can you find other parses for this sentence? How does the number of parse trees grow as the sentence gets longer? (More examples of these sentences can be found at¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homophonous_phrases).

‚óë You can modify the grammar in the recursive descent parser demo by selecting¬†Edit Grammar¬†in the¬†Edit¬†menu. Change the second expansion production, namely¬†NP -> Det N PP, to¬†NP -> NP PP. Using the¬†Step¬†button, try to build a parse tree. What happens?

‚óë Extend the grammar in¬†grammar2¬†with productions that expand prepositions as intransitive, transitive and requiring a¬†PP¬†complement. Based on these productions, use the method of the preceding exercise to draw a tree for the sentence¬†Lee ran away home.

‚óë Pick some common verbs and complete the following tasks:

Write a program to find those verbs in the Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus¬†nltk.corpus.ppattach. Find any cases where the same verb exhibits two different attachments, but where the first noun, or second noun, or preposition, stay unchanged (as we saw in our discussion of syntactic ambiguity in¬†2).

Devise CFG grammar productions to cover some of these cases.

‚óë Write a program to compare the efficiency of a top-down chart parser compared with a recursive descent parser (4). Use the same grammar and input sentences for both. Compare their performance using the¬†timeit¬†module (see¬†4.7¬†for an example of how to do this).

‚óë Compare the performance of the top-down, bottom-up, and left-corner parsers using the same grammar and three grammatical test sentences. Use¬†timeit¬†to log the amount of time each parser takes on the same sentence. Write a function that runs all three parsers on all three sentences, and prints a 3-by-3 grid of times, as well as row and column totals. Discuss your findings.

‚óë Read up on "garden path" sentences. How might the computational work of a parser relate to the difficulty humans have with processing these sentences?¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence

‚óë To compare multiple trees in a single window, we can use the¬†draw_trees()¬†method. Define some trees and try it out:

¬†>>> from nltk.draw.tree import draw_trees >>> draw_trees(tree1, tree2, tree3) 

‚óë Using tree positions, list the subjects of the first 100 sentences in the Penn treebank; to make the results easier to view, limit the extracted subjects to subtrees whose height is 2.

‚óë Inspect the Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus and try to suggest some factors that influence¬†PP¬†attachment.

‚óë In this section we claimed that there are linguistic regularities that cannot be described simply in terms of n-grams. Consider the following sentence, particularly the position of the phrase¬†in his turn. Does this illustrate a problem for an approach based on n-grams?

What was more, the in his turn somewhat youngish Nikolay Parfenovich also turned out to be the only person in the entire world to acquire a sincere liking to our "discriminated-against" public procurator.¬†(Dostoevsky: The Brothers Karamazov)

‚óë Write a recursive function that produces a nested bracketing for a tree, leaving out the leaf nodes, and displaying the non-terminal labels after their subtrees. So the above example about Pierre Vinken would produce:¬†[[[NNP NNP]NP , [ADJP [CD NNS]NP JJ]ADJP ,]NP-SBJ MD [VB [DT NN]NP [IN [DT JJ NN]NP]PP-CLR [NNP CD]NP-TMP]VP .]S¬†Consecutive categories should be separated by space.

‚óë Download several electronic books from Project Gutenberg. Write a program to scan these texts for any extremely long sentences. What is the longest sentence you can find? What syntactic construction(s) are responsible for such long sentences?

‚óë Modify the functions¬†init_wfst()¬†and¬†complete_wfst()¬†so that the contents of each cell in the WFST is a set of non-terminal symbols rather than a single non-terminal.

‚óë Consider the algorithm in¬†4.4. Can you explain why parsing context-free grammar is proportional to¬†n3, where¬†n¬†is the length of the input sentence.

‚óë Process each tree of the Treebank corpus sample¬†nltk.corpus.treebank¬†and extract the productions with the help of¬†Tree.productions(). Discard the productions that occur only once. Productions with the same left hand side, and similar right hand sides can be collapsed, resulting in an equivalent but more compact set of rules. Write code to output a compact grammar.

‚òÖ One common way of defining the subject of a sentence¬†S¬†in English is as¬†the noun phrase that is the child of¬†S¬†and the sibling of¬†VP. Write a function that takes the tree for a sentence and returns the subtree corresponding to the subject of the sentence. What should it do if the root node of the tree passed to this function is not¬†S, or it lacks a subject?

‚òÖ Write a function that takes a grammar (such as the one defined in¬†3.1) and returns a random sentence generated by the grammar. (Use¬†grammar.start()¬†to find the start symbol of the grammar;¬†grammar.productions(lhs)¬†to get the list of productions from the grammar that have the specified left-hand side; and¬†production.rhs()¬†to get the right-hand side of a production.)

‚òÖ Implement a version of the shift-reduce parser using backtracking, so that it finds all possible parses for a sentence, what might be called a "recursive ascent parser." Consult the Wikipedia entry for backtracking at¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking

‚òÖ As we saw in¬†7., it is possible to collapse chunks down to their chunk label. When we do this for sentences involving the word¬†gave, we find patterns such as the following:

gave NP gave up NP in NP gave NP up gave NP NP gave NP to NP 

Use this method to study the complementation patterns of a verb of interest, and write suitable grammar productions. (This task is sometimes called¬†lexical acquisition.)

Identify some English verbs that are near-synonyms, such as the¬†dumped/filled/loaded¬†example from earlier in this chapter. Use the chunking method to study the complementation patterns of these verbs. Create a grammar to cover these cases. Can the verbs be freely substituted for each other, or are their constraints? Discuss your findings.

‚òÖ Develop a left-corner parser based on the recursive descent parser, and inheriting from¬†ParseI.

‚òÖ Extend NLTK's shift-reduce parser to incorporate backtracking, so that it is guaranteed to find all parses that exist (i.e. it is¬†complete).

‚òÖ Modify the functions¬†init_wfst()¬†and¬†complete_wfst()¬†so that when a non-terminal symbol is added to a cell in the WFST, it includes a record of the cells from which it was derived. Implement a function that will convert a WFST in this form to a parse tree.

8. Analyzing Sentence Structure

Earlier chapters focused on words: how to identify them, analyze their structure, assign them to lexical categories, and access their meanings. We have also seen how to identify patterns in word sequences or n-grams. However, these methods only scratch the surface of the complex constraints that govern sentences. We need a way to deal with the ambiguity that natural language is famous for. We also need to be able to cope with the fact that there are an unlimited number of possible sentences, and we can only write finite programs to analyze their structures and discover their meanings.

The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:

How can we use a formal grammar to describe the structure of an unlimited set of sentences?

How do we represent the structure of sentences using syntax trees?

How do parsers analyze a sentence and automatically build a syntax tree?

Along the way, we will cover the fundamentals of English syntax, and see that there are systematic aspects of meaning that are much easier to capture once we have identified the structure of sentences.

1¬†¬†¬†Some Grammatical Dilemmas

1.1¬†¬†¬†Linguistic Data and Unlimited Possibilities

Previous chapters have shown you how to process and analyse text corpora, and we have stressed the challenges for NLP in dealing with the vast amount of electronic language data that is growing daily. Let's consider this data more closely, and make the thought experiment that we have a gigantic corpus consisting of everything that has been either uttered or written in English over, say, the last 50 years. Would we be justified in calling this corpus "the language of modern English"? There are a number of reasons why we might answer No. Recall that in¬†3, we asked you to search the web for instances of the pattern¬†the of. Although it is easy to find examples on the web containing this word sequence, such as¬†New man at the of IMG¬†(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2387900/New-man-at-the-of-IMG.html), speakers of English will say that most such examples are errors, and therefore not part of English after all.

Accordingly, we can argue that the "modern English" is not equivalent to the very big set of word sequences in our imaginary corpus. Speakers of English can make judgements about these sequences, and will reject some of them as being ungrammatical.

Equally, it is easy to compose a new sentence and have speakers agree that it is perfectly good English. For example, sentences have an interesting property that they can be embedded inside larger sentences. Consider the following sentences:

(1)

a.Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

b.The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

c.Andre said The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

d.I think Andre said the Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

If we replaced whole sentences with the symbol¬†S, we would see patterns like¬†Andre said¬†S¬†and¬†I think¬†S. These are templates for taking a sentence and constructing a bigger sentence. There are other templates we can use, like¬†S¬†but¬†S, and¬†S¬†when¬†S. With a bit of ingenuity we can construct some really long sentences using these templates. Here's an impressive example from a Winnie the Pooh story by A.A. Milne,¬†In which Piglet is Entirely Surrounded by Water:

[You can imagine Piglet's joy when at last the ship came in sight of him.] In after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very Great Danger during the Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had really been in was the last half-hour of his imprisonment, when Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort him, and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid a seagull's egg by mistake, and the story went on and on, rather like this sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his window without much hope, went to sleep quietly and naturally, slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until he was only hanging on by his toes, at which moment, luckily, a sudden loud squawk from Owl, which was really part of the story, being what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself back into safety and say, "How interesting, and did she?" when ‚Äî well, you can imagine his joy when at last he saw the good ship, Brain of Pooh (Captain, C. Robin; 1st Mate, P. Bear) coming over the sea to rescue him...

This long sentence actually has a simple structure that begins¬†S but S when S. We can see from this example that language provides us with constructions which seem to allow us to extend sentences indefinitely. It is also striking that we can understand sentences of arbitrary length that we've never heard before: it's not hard to concoct an entirely novel sentence, one that has probably never been used before in the history of the language, yet all speakers of the language will understand it.

The purpose of a grammar is to give an explicit description of a language. But the way in which we think of a grammar is closely intertwined with what we consider to be a language. Is it a large but finite set of observed utterances and written texts? Is it something more abstract like the implicit knowledge that competent speakers have about grammatical sentences? Or is it some combination of the two? We won't take a stand on this issue, but instead will introduce the main approaches.

In this chapter, we will adopt the formal framework of "generative grammar", in which a "language" is considered to be nothing more than an enormous collection of all grammatical sentences, and a grammar is a formal notation that can be used for "generating" the members of this set. Grammars use recursive¬†productions¬†of the form¬†S¬†‚Üí¬†S¬†and¬†S, as we will explore in¬†3. In¬†10.¬†we will extend this, to automatically build up the meaning of a sentence out of the meanings of its parts.

1.2¬†¬†¬†Ubiquitous Ambiguity

A well-known example of ambiguity is shown in¬†(2), from the Groucho Marx movie,¬†Animal Crackers¬†(1930):

(2)While hunting in Africa, I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas, I don't know.

Let's take a closer look at the ambiguity in the phrase:¬†I shot an elephant in my pajamas. First we need to define a simple grammar:

¬†>>> groucho_grammar = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" ... S -> NP VP ... PP -> P NP ... NP -> Det N | Det N PP | 'I' ... VP -> V NP | VP PP ... Det -> 'an' | 'my' ... N -> 'elephant' | 'pajamas' ... V -> 'shot' ... P -> 'in' ... """)

This grammar permits the sentence to be analyzed in two ways, depending on whether the prepositional phrase¬†in my pajamas¬†describes the elephant or the shooting event.

¬†>>> sent = ['I', 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas'] >>> parser = nltk.ChartParser(groucho_grammar) >>> for tree in parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) ... (S (NP I) (VP (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant))) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))) (S (NP I) (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))))

The program produces two bracketed structures, which we can depict as trees, as shown in¬†(3b):

(3)

a.Ôøº

b.Ôøº

Notice that there's no ambiguity concerning the meaning of any of the words; e.g. the word¬†shot¬†doesn't refer to the act of using a gun in the first sentence, and using a camera in the second sentence.

Note

Your Turn:¬†Consider the following sentences and see if you can think of two quite different interpretations:¬†Fighting animals could be dangerous.¬†Visiting relatives can be tiresome.¬†Is ambiguity of the individual words to blame? If not, what is the cause of the ambiguity?

This chapter presents grammars and parsing, as the formal and computational methods for investigating and modeling the linguistic phenomena we have been discussing. As we shall see, patterns of well-formedness and ill-formedness in a sequence of words can be understood with respect to the phrase structure and dependencies. We can develop formal models of these structures using grammars and parsers. As before, a key motivation is natural language¬†understanding. How much more of the meaning of a text can we access when we can reliably recognize the linguistic structures it contains? Having read in a text, can a program "understand" it enough to be able to answer simple questions about "what happened" or "who did what to whom"? Also as before, we will develop simple programs to process annotated corpora and perform useful tasks.

2¬†¬†¬†What's the Use of Syntax?

2.1¬†¬†¬†Beyond n-grams

We gave an example in¬†2.¬†of how to use the frequency information in bigrams to generate text that seems perfectly acceptable for small sequences of words but rapidly degenerates into nonsense. Here's another pair of examples that we created by computing the bigrams over the text of a childrens' story,¬†The Adventures of Buster Brown¬†(http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22816/22816.txt):

(4)

a.He roared with me the pail slip down his back

b.The worst part and clumsy looking for whoever heard light

You intuitively know that these sequences are "word-salad", but you probably find it hard to pin down what's wrong with them. One benefit of studying grammar is that it provides a conceptual framework and vocabulary for spelling out these intuitions. Let's take a closer look at the sequence¬†the worst part and clumsy looking. This looks like a¬†coordinate structure, where two phrases are joined by a coordinating conjunction such as¬†and,¬†but¬†or¬†or. Here's an informal (and simplified) statement of how coordination works syntactically:

Coordinate Structure:

If¬†v1¬†and¬†v2¬†are both phrases of grammatical category¬†X, then¬†v1¬†and¬†v2¬†is also a phrase of category¬†X.

Here are a couple of examples. In the first, two¬†NPs (noun phrases) have been conjoined to make an¬†NP, while in the second, two¬†APs (adjective phrases) have been conjoined to make an¬†AP.

(5)

a.The book's ending was (NP¬†the worst part and the best part) for me.

b.On land they are (AP¬†slow and clumsy looking).

What we¬†can't¬†do is conjoin an¬†NP¬†and an¬†AP, which is why¬†the worst part and clumsy looking¬†is ungrammatical. Before we can formalize these ideas, we need to understand the concept of¬†constituent structure.

Constituent structure is based on the observation that words combine with other words to form units. The evidence that a sequence of words forms such a unit is given by substitutability ‚Äî that is, a sequence of words in a well-formed sentence can be replaced by a shorter sequence without rendering the sentence ill-formed. To clarify this idea, consider the following sentence:

(6)The little bear saw the fine fat trout in the brook.

The fact that we can substitute¬†He¬†for¬†The little bear¬†indicates that the latter sequence is a unit. By contrast, we cannot replace¬†little bear saw¬†in the same way.

(7)

a.He saw the fine fat trout in the brook.

b.*The he the fine fat trout in the brook.

In¬†2.1, we systematically substitute longer sequences by shorter ones in a way which preserves grammaticality. Each sequence that forms a unit can in fact be replaced by a single word, and we end up with just two elements.

Ôøº

Figure 2.1: Substitution of Word Sequences: working from the top row, we can replace particular sequences of words (e.g.¬†the brook) with individual words (e.g.¬†it); repeating this process we arrive at a grammatical two-word sentence.

In¬†2.2, we have added grammatical category labels to the words we saw in the earlier figure. The labels¬†NP,¬†VP, and¬†PP¬†stand for¬†noun phrase,¬†verb phrase¬†and¬†prepositional phrase¬†respectively.

Ôøº

Figure 2.2: Substitution of Word Sequences Plus Grammatical Categories: This diagram reproduces¬†2.1¬†along with grammatical categories corresponding to noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), prepositional phrases (PP), and nominals (Nom).

If we now strip out the words apart from the topmost row, add an¬†S¬†node, and flip the figure over, we end up with a standard phrase structure tree, shown in¬†(8). Each node in this tree (including the words) is called a¬†constituent. The¬†immediate constituents¬†of¬†S¬†are¬†NP¬†and¬†VP.

(8)Ôøº

As we will see in the next section, a grammar specifies how the sentence can be subdivided into its immediate constituents, and how these can be further subdivided until we reach the level of individual words.

Note

As we saw in¬†1, sentences can have arbitrary length. Consequently, phrase structure trees can have arbitrary¬†depth. The cascaded chunk parsers we saw in¬†4¬†can only produce structures of bounded depth, so chunking methods aren't applicable here.

3¬†¬†¬†Context Free Grammar

3.1¬†¬†¬†A Simple Grammar

Let's start off by looking at a simple context-free grammar. By convention, the left-hand-side of the first production is the¬†start-symbol¬†of the grammar, typically¬†S, and all well-formed trees must have this symbol as their root label. In NLTK, context-free grammars are defined in the¬†nltk.grammar¬†module. In¬†3.1¬†we define a grammar and show how to parse a simple sentence admitted by the grammar.

¬†grammar1 = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" S -> NP VP VP -> V NP | V NP PP PP -> P NP V -> "saw" | "ate" | "walked" NP -> "John" | "Mary" | "Bob" | Det N | Det N PP Det -> "a" | "an" | "the" | "my" N -> "man" | "dog" | "cat" | "telescope" | "park" P -> "in" | "on" | "by" | "with" """)¬†>>> sent = "Mary saw Bob".split() >>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> for tree in rd_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP Bob)))

Example 3.1 (code_cfg1.py):¬†Figure 3.1: A Simple Context-Free Grammar

The grammar in¬†3.1¬†contains productions involving various syntactic categories, as laid out in¬†3.1.

Table 3.1:

A production like¬†VP -> V NP | V NP PP¬†has a disjunction on the righthand side, shown by the¬†|¬†and is an abbreviation for the two productions¬†VP -> V NP¬†and¬†VP -> V NP PP.

Ôøº

Figure 3.2: Recursive Descent Parser Demo: This tool allows you to watch the operation of a recursive descent parser as it grows the parse tree and matches it against the input words.

Note

Your Turn:¬†Try developing a simple grammar of your own, using the recursive descent parser application,¬†nltk.app.rdparser(), shown in¬†3.2. It comes already loaded with a sample grammar, but you can edit this as you please (using the¬†Edit¬†menu). Change the grammar, and the sentence to be parsed, and run the parser using the¬†autostep¬†button.

If we parse the sentence¬†The dog saw a man in the park¬†using the grammar shown in¬†3.1, we end up with two trees, similar to those we saw for¬†(3b):

(9)

a.Ôøº

b.Ôøº

Since our grammar licenses two trees for this sentence, the sentence is said to be¬†structurally ambiguous. The ambiguity in question is called a¬†prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity, as we saw earlier in this chapter. As you may recall, it is an ambiguity about attachment since the¬†PP¬†in the park¬†needs to be attached to one of two places in the tree: either as a child of¬†VP¬†or else as a child of¬†NP. When the¬†PP¬†is attached to¬†VP, the intended interpretation is that the seeing event happened in the park. However, if the¬†PP¬†is attached to¬†NP, then it was the man who was in the park, and the agent of the seeing (the dog) might have been sitting on the balcony of an apartment overlooking the park.

3.2¬†¬†¬†Writing Your Own Grammars

If you are interested in experimenting with writing CFGs, you will find it helpful to create and edit your grammar in a text file, say¬†mygrammar.cfg. You can then load it into NLTK and parse with it as follows:

¬†>>> grammar1 = nltk.data.load('file:mygrammar.cfg') >>> sent = "Mary saw Bob".split() >>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> for tree in rd_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree)

Make sure that you put a¬†.cfg¬†suffix on the filename, and that there are no spaces in the string¬†'file:mygrammar.cfg'. If the command¬†print(tree)¬†produces no output, this is probably because your sentence¬†sent¬†is not admitted by your grammar. In this case, call the parser with tracing set to be on:¬†rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1, trace=2). You can also check what productions are currently in the grammar with the command¬†for¬†p¬†in¬†grammar1.productions():¬†print(p).

When you write CFGs for parsing in NLTK, you cannot combine grammatical categories with lexical items on the righthand side of the same production. Thus, a production such as¬†PP ->¬†'of'¬†NP¬†is disallowed. In addition, you are not permitted to place multi-word lexical items on the righthand side of a production. So rather than writing¬†NP ->¬†'New¬†York', you have to resort to something like¬†NP ->¬†'New_York'¬†instead.

3.3¬†¬†¬†Recursion in Syntactic Structure

A grammar is said to be¬†recursive¬†if a category occurring on the left hand side of a production also appears on the righthand side of a production, as illustrated in¬†3.3. The production¬†Nom -> Adj Nom¬†(where¬†Nom¬†is the category of nominals) involves direct recursion on the category¬†Nom, whereas indirect recursion on¬†S¬†arises from the combination of two productions, namely¬†S -> NP VP¬†and¬†VP -> V S.

¬†grammar2 = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" S -> NP VP NP -> Det Nom | PropN Nom -> Adj Nom | N VP -> V Adj | V NP | V S | V NP PP PP -> P NP PropN -> 'Buster' | 'Chatterer' | 'Joe' Det -> 'the' | 'a' N -> 'bear' | 'squirrel' | 'tree' | 'fish' | 'log' Adj -> 'angry' | 'frightened' | 'little' | 'tall' V -> 'chased' | 'saw' | 'said' | 'thought' | 'was' | 'put' P -> 'on' """)

Example 3.3 (code_cfg2.py):¬†Figure 3.3: A Recursive Context-Free Grammar

To see how recursion arises from this grammar, consider the following trees.¬†(10a)¬†involves nested nominal phrases, while¬†(10b)¬†contains nested sentences.

We've only illustrated two levels of recursion here, but there's no upper limit on the depth. You can experiment with parsing sentences that involve more deeply nested structures. Beware that the¬†RecursiveDescentParser¬†is unable to handle¬†left-recursive¬†productions of the form¬†X -> X Y; we will return to this in¬†4.

4¬†¬†¬†Parsing With Context Free Grammar

A¬†parser¬†processes input sentences according to the productions of a grammar, and builds one or more constituent structures that conform to the grammar. A grammar is a declarative specification of well-formedness ‚Äî it is actually just a string, not a program. A parser is a procedural interpretation of the grammar. It searches through the space of trees licensed by a grammar to find one that has the required sentence along its fringe.

A parser permits a grammar to be evaluated against a collection of test sentences, helping linguists to discover mistakes in their grammatical analysis. A parser can serve as a model of psycholinguistic processing, helping to explain the difficulties that humans have with processing certain syntactic constructions. Many natural language applications involve parsing at some point; for example, we would expect the natural language questions submitted to a question-answering system to undergo parsing as an initial step.

In this section we see two simple parsing algorithms, a top-down method called recursive descent parsing, and a bottom-up method called shift-reduce parsing. We also see some more sophisticated algorithms, a top-down method with bottom-up filtering called left-corner parsing, and a dynamic programming technique called chart parsing.

4.1¬†¬†¬†Recursive Descent Parsing

The simplest kind of parser interprets a grammar as a specification of how to break a high-level goal into several lower-level subgoals. The top-level goal is to find an¬†S. The¬†S¬†‚Üí¬†NP VP¬†production permits the parser to replace this goal with two subgoals: find an¬†NP, then find a¬†VP. Each of these subgoals can be replaced in turn by sub-sub-goals, using productions that have¬†NP¬†and¬†VP¬†on their left-hand side. Eventually, this expansion process leads to subgoals such as: find the word¬†telescope. Such subgoals can be directly compared against the input sequence, and succeed if the next word is matched. If there is no match the parser must back up and try a different alternative.

The recursive descent parser builds a parse tree during the above process. With the initial goal (find an¬†S), the¬†S¬†root node is created. As the above process recursively expands its goals using the productions of the grammar, the parse tree is extended downwards (hence the name¬†recursive descent). We can see this in action using the graphical demonstration¬†nltk.app.rdparser(). Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in¬†4.1.

Ôøº

Figure 4.1: Six Stages of a Recursive Descent Parser: the parser begins with a tree consisting of the node¬†S; at each stage it consults the grammar to find a production that can be used to enlarge the tree; when a lexical production is encountered, its word is compared against the input; after a complete parse has been found, the parser backtracks to look for more parses.

During this process, the parser is often forced to choose between several possible productions. For example, in going from step 3 to step 4, it tries to find productions with¬†N¬†on the left-hand side. The first of these is¬†N¬†‚Üí¬†man. When this does not work it¬†backtracks, and tries other¬†N¬†productions in order, until it gets to¬†N¬†‚Üí¬†dog, which matches the next word in the input sentence. Much later, as shown in step 5, it finds a complete parse. This is a tree that covers the entire sentence, without any dangling edges. Once a parse has been found, we can get the parser to look for additional parses. Again it will backtrack and explore other choices of production in case any of them result in a parse.

NLTK provides a recursive descent parser:

¬†>>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> sent = 'Mary saw a dog'.split() >>> for tree in rd_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog))))

Note

RecursiveDescentParser()¬†takes an optional parameter¬†trace. If¬†trace¬†is greater than zero, then the parser will report the steps that it takes as it parses a text.

Recursive descent parsing has three key shortcomings. First, left-recursive productions like¬†NP -> NP PP¬†send it into an infinite loop. Second, the parser wastes a lot of time considering words and structures that do not correspond to the input sentence. Third, the backtracking process may discard parsed constituents that will need to be rebuilt again later. For example, backtracking over¬†VP -> V NP¬†will discard the subtree created for the¬†NP. If the parser then proceeds with¬†VP -> V NP PP, then the¬†NP¬†subtree must be created all over again.

Recursive descent parsing is a kind of¬†top-down parsing. Top-down parsers use a grammar to¬†predict¬†what the input will be, before inspecting the input! However, since the input is available to the parser all along, it would be more sensible to consider the input sentence from the very beginning. This approach is called¬†bottom-up parsing, and we will see an example in the next section.

4.2¬†¬†¬†Shift-Reduce Parsing

A simple kind of bottom-up parser is the¬†shift-reduce parser. In common with all bottom-up parsers, a shift-reduce parser tries to find sequences of words and phrases that correspond to the¬†right hand¬†side of a grammar production, and replace them with the left-hand side, until the whole sentence is reduced to an¬†S.

The shift-reduce parser repeatedly pushes the next input word onto a stack (4.1); this is the¬†shift¬†operation. If the top¬†n¬†items on the stack match the¬†n¬†items on the right hand side of some production, then they are all popped off the stack, and the item on the left-hand side of the production is pushed on the stack. This replacement of the top¬†n¬†items with a single item is the¬†reduce¬†operation. This operation may only be applied to the top of the stack; reducing items lower in the stack must be done before later items are pushed onto the stack. The parser finishes when all the input is consumed and there is only one item remaining on the stack, a parse tree with an¬†S¬†node as its root. The shift-reduce parser builds a parse tree during the above process. Each time it pops¬†n¬†items off the stack it combines them into a partial parse tree, and pushes this back on the stack. We can see the shift-reduce parsing algorithm in action using the graphical demonstration¬†nltk.app.srparser(). Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in¬†4.2.

Ôøº

Figure 4.2: Six Stages of a Shift-Reduce Parser: the parser begins by shifting the first input word onto its stack; once the top items on the stack match the right hand side of a grammar production, they can be replaced with the left hand side of that production; the parser succeeds once all input is consumed and one¬†S¬†item remains on the stack.

NLTK provides¬†ShiftReduceParser(), a simple implementation of a shift-reduce parser. This parser does not implement any backtracking, so it is not guaranteed to find a parse for a text, even if one exists. Furthermore, it will only find at most one parse, even if more parses exist. We can provide an optional¬†trace¬†parameter that controls how verbosely the parser reports the steps that it takes as it parses a text:

¬†>>> sr_parser = nltk.ShiftReduceParser(grammar1) >>> sent = 'Mary saw a dog'.split() >>> for tree in sr_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog))))

Note

Your Turn:¬†Run the above parser in tracing mode to see the sequence of shift and reduce operations, using¬†sr_parse = nltk.ShiftReduceParser(grammar1, trace=2)

A shift-reduce parser can reach a dead end and fail to find any parse, even if the input sentence is well-formed according to the grammar. When this happens, no input remains, and the stack contains items which cannot be reduced to an¬†S. The problem arises because there are choices made earlier that cannot be undone by the parser (although users of the graphical demonstration can undo their choices). There are two kinds of choices to be made by the parser: (a) which reduction to do when more than one is possible (b) whether to shift or reduce when either action is possible.

A shift-reduce parser may be extended to implement policies for resolving such conflicts. For example, it may address shift-reduce conflicts by shifting only when no reductions are possible, and it may address reduce-reduce conflicts by favoring the reduction operation that removes the most items from the stack. (A generalization of shift-reduce parser, a "lookahead LR parser", is commonly used in programming language compilers.)

The advantage of shift-reduce parsers over recursive descent parsers is that they only build structure that corresponds to the words in the input. Furthermore, they only build each sub-structure once, e.g.¬†NP(Det(the), N(man))¬†is only built and pushed onto the stack a single time, regardless of whether it will later be used by the¬†VP -> V NP PP¬†reduction or the¬†NP -> NP PP¬†reduction.

4.3¬†¬†¬†The Left-Corner Parser

One of the problems with the recursive descent parser is that it goes into an infinite loop when it encounters a left-recursive production. This is because it applies the grammar productions blindly, without considering the actual input sentence. A left-corner parser is a hybrid between the bottom-up and top-down approaches we have seen.

Grammar¬†grammar1¬†allows us to produce the following parse of¬†John saw Mary:

(11)Ôøº

Recall that the grammar (defined in¬†3.3) has the following productions for expanding¬†NP:

(12)

a.NP -> Det N

b.NP -> Det N PP

c.NP ->¬†"John"¬†|¬†"Mary"¬†|¬†"Bob"

Suppose we ask you to first look at tree¬†(11), and then decide which of the¬†NP¬†productions you'd want a recursive descent parser to apply first ‚Äî obviously,¬†(12c)¬†is the right choice! How do you know that it would be pointless to apply¬†(12a)¬†or¬†(12b)¬†instead? Because neither of these productions will derive a sequence whose first word is¬†John. That is, we can easily tell that in a successful parse of¬†John saw Mary, the parser has to expand¬†NP¬†in such a way that¬†NP¬†derives the sequence¬†John¬†Œ±. More generally, we say that a category¬†B¬†is a¬†left-corner¬†of a tree rooted in¬†A¬†if¬†A¬†‚áí*¬†B¬†Œ±.

(13)Ôøº

A¬†left-corner parser¬†is a top-down parser with bottom-up filtering. Unlike an ordinary recursive descent parser, it does not get trapped in left recursive productions. Before starting its work, a left-corner parser preprocesses the context-free grammar to build a table where each row contains two cells, the first holding a non-terminal, and the second holding the collection of possible left corners of that non-terminal.¬†4.1¬†illustrates this for the grammar from¬†grammar2.

Table 4.1:

Left-Corners in¬†grammar2

CategoryLeft-Corners (pre-terminals)SNPNPDet, PropNVPVPPP

Each time a production is considered by the parser, it checks that the next input word is compatible with at least one of the pre-terminal categories in the left-corner table.

4.4¬†¬†¬†Well-Formed Substring Tables

The simple parsers discussed above suffer from limitations in both completeness and efficiency. In order to remedy these, we will apply the algorithm design technique of¬†dynamic programming¬†to the parsing problem. As we saw in¬†4.7, dynamic programming stores intermediate results and re-uses them when appropriate, achieving significant efficiency gains. This technique can be applied to syntactic parsing, allowing us to store partial solutions to the parsing task and then look them up as necessary in order to efficiently arrive at a complete solution. This approach to parsing is known as¬†chart parsing. We introduce the main idea in this section; see the online materials available for this chapter for more implementation details.

Dynamic programming allows us to build the¬†PP¬†in my pajamas¬†just once. The first time we build it we save it in a table, then we look it up when we need to use it as a subconstituent of either the object¬†NP¬†or the higher¬†VP. This table is known as a¬†well-formed substring table, or WFST for short. (The term "substring" refers to a contiguous sequence of words within a sentence.) We will show how to construct the WFST bottom-up so as to systematically record what syntactic constituents have been found.

Let's set our input to be the sentence in¬†(2). The numerically specified spans of the WFST are reminiscent of Python's slice notation (3.2). Another way to think about the data structure is shown in¬†4.3, a data structure known as a¬†chart.

Ôøº

Figure 4.3: The Chart Data Structure: words are the edge labels of a linear graph structure.

In a WFST, we record the position of the words by filling in cells in a triangular matrix: the vertical axis will denote the start position of a substring, while the horizontal axis will denote the end position (thus¬†shot¬†will appear in the cell with coordinates (1, 2)). To simplify this presentation, we will assume each word has a unique lexical category, and we will store this (not the word) in the matrix. So cell (1, 2) will contain the entry¬†V. More generally, if our input string is¬†a0a1¬†...¬†an, and our grammar contains a production of the form¬†A¬†‚Üí¬†ai, then we add¬†A¬†to the cell (i,¬†`i`+1).

System Message: WARNING/2 (ch08.rst2, line 900);¬†backlink

Inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end-string.

So, for every word in¬†text, we can look up in our grammar what category it belongs to.

¬†>>> text = ['I', 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas'] >>> groucho_grammar.productions(rhs=text[1]) [V -> 'shot']

For our WFST, we create an¬†(n-1)¬†√ó¬†(n-1)¬†matrix as a list of lists in Python, and initialize it with the lexical categories of each token, in the¬†init_wfst()¬†function in¬†4.4. We also define a utility function¬†display()¬†to pretty-print the WFST for us. As expected, there is a¬†V¬†in cell (1, 2).

¬†def init_wfst(tokens, grammar): numtokens = len(tokens) wfst = [[None for i in range(numtokens+1)] for j in range(numtokens+1)] for i in range(numtokens): productions = grammar.productions(rhs=tokens[i]) wfst[i][i+1] = productions[0].lhs() return wfst def complete_wfst(wfst, tokens, grammar, trace=False): index = dict((p.rhs(), p.lhs()) for p in grammar.productions()) numtokens = len(tokens) for span in range(2, numtokens+1): for start in range(numtokens+1-span): end = start + span for mid in range(start+1, end): nt1, nt2 = wfst[start][mid], wfst[mid][end] if nt1 and nt2 and (nt1,nt2) in index: wfst[start][end] = index[(nt1,nt2)] if trace: print("[%s] %3s [%s] %3s [%s] ==> [%s] %3s [%s]" % \ (start, nt1, mid, nt2, end, start, index[(nt1,nt2)], end)) return wfst def display(wfst, tokens): print('\nWFST ' + ' '.join(("%-4d" % i) for i in range(1, len(wfst)))) for i in range(len(wfst)-1): print("%d " % i, end=" ") for j in range(1, len(wfst)): print("%-4s" % (wfst[i][j] or '.'), end=" ") print() >>> tokens = "I shot an elephant in my pajamas".split() >>> wfst0 = init_wfst(tokens, groucho_grammar) >>> display(wfst0, tokens) WFST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 NP . . . . . . 1 . V . . . . . 2 . . Det . . . . 3 . . . N . . . 4 . . . . P . . 5 . . . . . Det . 6 . . . . . . N >>> wfst1 = complete_wfst(wfst0, tokens, groucho_grammar) >>> display(wfst1, tokens) WFST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 NP . . S . . S 1 . V . VP . . VP 2 . . Det NP . . . 3 . . . N . . . 4 . . . . P . PP 5 . . . . . Det NP 6 . . . . . . N

Example 4.4 (code_wfst.py):¬†Figure 4.4: Acceptor Using Well-Formed Substring Table

Returning to our tabular representation, given that we have¬†Det¬†in cell (2, 3) for the word¬†an, and¬†N¬†in cell (3, 4) for the word¬†elephant, what should we put into cell (2, 4) for¬†an elephant? We need to find a production of the form¬†A¬†‚Üí¬†Det N. Consulting the grammar, we know that we can enter¬†NP¬†in cell (2, 4).

More generally, we can enter¬†A¬†in¬†(i, j)¬†if there is a production¬†A¬†‚Üí¬†B¬†C, and we find nonterminal¬†B¬†in¬†(i, k)¬†and¬†C¬†in¬†(k, j). The program in¬†4.4¬†uses this rule to complete the WFST. By setting¬†trace¬†to¬†True¬†when calling the function¬†complete_wfst(), we see tracing output that shows the WFST being constructed:

¬†>>> wfst1 = complete_wfst(wfst0, tokens, groucho_grammar, trace=True) [2] Det [3] N [4] ==> [2] NP [4] [5] Det [6] N [7] ==> [5] NP [7] [1] V [2] NP [4] ==> [1] VP [4] [4] P [5] NP [7] ==> [4] PP [7] [0] NP [1] VP [4] ==> [0] S [4] [1] VP [4] PP [7] ==> [1] VP [7] [0] NP [1] VP [7] ==> [0] S [7]

For example, this says that since we found¬†Det¬†at¬†wfst[2][3]¬†and¬†N¬†at¬†wfst[3][4], we can add¬†NP¬†to¬†wfst[2][4].

Note

To help us easily retrieve productions by their right hand sides, we create an index for the grammar. This is an example of a space-time trade-off: we do a reverse lookup on the grammar, instead of having to check through the entire list of productions each time we want to look up via the right hand side.

Ôøº

Figure 4.5: The Chart Data Structure: non-terminals are represented as extra edges in the chart.

We conclude that there is a parse for the whole input string once we have constructed an¬†S¬†node in cell (0, 7), showing that we have found a sentence that covers the whole input. The final state of the WFST is depicted in¬†4.5.

Notice that we have not used any built-in parsing functions here. We've implemented a complete, primitive chart parser from the ground up!

WFST's have several shortcomings. First, as you can see, the WFST is not itself a parse tree, so the technique is strictly speaking¬†recognizing¬†that a sentence is admitted by a grammar, rather than parsing it. Second, it requires every non-lexical grammar production to be¬†binary. Although it is possible to convert an arbitrary CFG into this form, we would prefer to use an approach without such a requirement. Third, as a bottom-up approach it is potentially wasteful, being able to propose constituents in locations that would not be licensed by the grammar.

Finally, the WFST did not represent the structural ambiguity in the sentence (i.e. the two verb phrase readings). The¬†VP¬†in cell (1, 7) was actually entered twice, once for a¬†V NP¬†reading, and once for a¬†VP PP¬†reading. These are different hypotheses, and the second overwrote the first (as it happens this didn't matter since the left hand side was the same.) Chart parsers use a slighly richer data structure and some interesting algorithms to solve these problems (see the Further Reading section at the end of this chapter for details).

5¬†¬†¬†Dependencies and Dependency Grammar

Phrase structure grammar is concerned with how words and sequences of words¬†combine¬†to form constituents. A distinct and complementary approach, dependency grammar, focusses instead on how words¬†relate¬†to other words. Dependency is a binary asymmetric relation that holds between a¬†head¬†and its¬†dependents. The head of a sentence is usually taken to be the tensed verb, and every other word is either dependent on the sentence head, or connects to it through a path of dependencies.

A dependency representation is a labeled directed graph, where the nodes are the lexical items and the labeled arcs represent dependency relations from heads to dependents.¬†5.1¬†illustrates a dependency graph, where arrows point from heads to their dependents.

Ôøº

Figure 5.1: Dependency Structure: arrows point from heads to their dependents; labels indicate the grammatical function of the dependent as subject, object or modifier.

The arcs in¬†5.1¬†are labeled with the grammatical function that holds between a dependent and its head. For example,¬†I¬†is the¬†SBJ¬†(subject) of¬†shot¬†(which is the head of the whole sentence), and¬†in¬†is an¬†NMOD¬†(noun modifier of¬†elephant). In contrast to phrase structure grammar, therefore, dependency grammars can be used to directly express grammatical functions as a type of dependency.

Here's one way of encoding a dependency grammar in NLTK ‚Äî note that it only captures bare dependency information without specifying the type of dependency:

¬†>>> groucho_dep_grammar = nltk.DependencyGrammar.fromstring(""" ... 'shot' -> 'I' | 'elephant' | 'in' ... 'elephant' -> 'an' | 'in' ... 'in' -> 'pajamas' ... 'pajamas' -> 'my' ... """) >>> print(groucho_dep_grammar) Dependency grammar with 7 productions 'shot' -> 'I' 'shot' -> 'elephant' 'shot' -> 'in' 'elephant' -> 'an' 'elephant' -> 'in' 'in' -> 'pajamas' 'pajamas' -> 'my'

A dependency graph is¬†projective¬†if, when all the words are written in linear order, the edges can be drawn above the words without crossing. This is equivalent to saying that a word and all its descendents (dependents and dependents of its dependents, etc.) form a contiguous sequence of words within the sentence.¬†5.1¬†is projective, and we can parse many sentences in English using a projective dependency parser. The next example shows how¬†groucho_dep_grammar¬†provides an alternative approach to capturing the attachment ambiguity that we examined earlier with phrase structure grammar.

¬†>>> pdp = nltk.ProjectiveDependencyParser(groucho_dep_grammar) >>> sent = 'I shot an elephant in my pajamas'.split() >>> trees = pdp.parse(sent) >>> for tree in trees: ... print(tree) (shot I (elephant an (in (pajamas my)))) (shot I (elephant an) (in (pajamas my)))

These bracketed dependency structures can also be displayed as trees, where dependents are shown as children of their heads.

(14)ÔøºÔøº

In languages with more flexible word order than English, non-projective dependencies are more frequent.

Various criteria have been proposed for deciding what is the head¬†H¬†and what is the dependent¬†D¬†in a construction¬†C. Some of the most important are the following:

H¬†determines the distribution class of¬†C; or alternatively, the external syntactic properties of¬†C¬†are due to¬†H.

H¬†determines the semantic type of¬†C.

H¬†is obligatory while¬†D¬†may be optional.

H¬†selects¬†D¬†and determines whether it is obligatory or optional.

The morphological form of¬†D¬†is determined by¬†H¬†(e.g. agreement or case government).

When we say in a phrase structure grammar that the immediate constituents of a¬†PP¬†are¬†P¬†and¬†NP, we are implicitly appealing to the head / dependent distinction. A prepositional phrase is a phrase whose head is a preposition; moreover, the¬†NP¬†is a dependent of¬†P. The same distinction carries over to the other types of phrase that we have discussed. The key point to note here is that although phrase structure grammars seem very different from dependency grammars, they implicitly embody a recognition of dependency relations. While CFGs are not intended to directly capture dependencies, more recent linguistic frameworks have increasingly adopted formalisms which combine aspects of both approaches.

5.1¬†¬†¬†Valency and the Lexicon

Let us take a closer look at verbs and their dependents. The grammar in¬†3.3¬†correctly generates examples like¬†(15d).

(15)

a.The squirrel was frightened.

b.Chatterer saw the bear.

c.Chatterer thought Buster was angry.

d.Joe put the fish on the log.

These possibilities correspond to the following productions:

Table 5.1:

VP productions and their lexical heads

VP -> V AdjwasVP -> V NPsawVP -> V SthoughtVP -> V NP PPput

That is,¬†was¬†can occur with a following¬†Adj,¬†saw¬†can occur with a following¬†NP,¬†thought¬†can occur with a following¬†S¬†and¬†put¬†can occur with a following¬†NP¬†and¬†PP. The dependents¬†Adj,¬†NP,¬†PP¬†and¬†S¬†are often called¬†complements¬†of the respective verbs and there are strong constraints on what verbs can occur with what complements. By contrast with¬†(15d), the word sequences in¬†(16d)¬†are ill-formed:

(16)

a.*The squirrel was Buster was angry.

b.*Chatterer saw frightened.

c.*Chatterer thought the bear.

d.*Joe put on the log.

Note

With a little imagination, it is possible to invent contexts in which unusual combinations of verbs and complements are interpretable. However, we assume that the above examples are to be interpreted in neutral contexts.

In the tradition of dependency grammar, the verbs in¬†5.1¬†are said to have different¬†valencies. Valency restrictions are not just applicable to verbs, but also to the other classes of heads.

Within frameworks based on phrase structure grammar, various techniques have been proposed for excluding the ungrammatical examples in¬†(16d). In a CFG, we need some way of constraining grammar productions which expand¬†VP¬†so that verbs¬†only¬†co-occur with their correct complements. We can do this by dividing the class of verbs into "subcategories", each of which is associated with a different set of complements. For example,¬†transitive verbs¬†such as¬†chased¬†and¬†saw¬†require a following¬†NP¬†object complement; that is, they are¬†subcategorized¬†for¬†NP¬†direct objects. If we introduce a new category label for transitive verbs, namely¬†TV¬†(for Transitive Verb), then we can use it in the following productions:

VP -> TV NP TV -> 'chased' | 'saw' 

Now¬†*Joe thought the bear¬†is excluded since we haven't listed¬†thought¬†as a¬†TV, but¬†Chatterer saw the bear¬†is still allowed.¬†5.2¬†provides more examples of labels for verb subcategories.

Table 5.2:

Verb Subcategories

SymbolMeaningExampleIVintransitive verbbarkedTVtransitive verbsaw a manDatVdative verbgave a dog to a manSVsentential verbsaid that a dog barked

Valency is a property of lexical items, and we will discuss it further in¬†9..

Complements are often contrasted with modifiers (or adjuncts), although both are kinds of dependent. Prepositional phrases, adjectives and adverbs typically function as modifiers. Unlike complements, modifiers are optional, can often be iterated, and are not selected for by heads in the same way as complements. For example, the adverb¬†really¬†can be added as a modifer to all the sentence in¬†(17d):

(17)

a.The squirrel really was frightened.

b.Chatterer really saw the bear.

c.Chatterer really thought Buster was angry.

d.Joe really put the fish on the log.

The structural ambiguity of¬†PP¬†attachment, which we have illustrated in both phrase structure and dependency grammars, corresponds semantically to an ambiguity in the scope of the modifier.

5.2¬†¬†¬†Scaling Up

So far, we have only considered "toy grammars," small grammars that illustrate the key aspects of parsing. But there is an obvious question as to whether the approach can be scaled up to cover large corpora of natural languages. How hard would it be to construct such a set of productions by hand? In general, the answer is:¬†very hard. Even if we allow ourselves to use various formal devices that give much more succinct representations of grammar productions, it is still extremely difficult to keep control of the complex interactions between the many productions required to cover the major constructions of a language. In other words, it is hard to modularize grammars so that one portion can be developed independently of the other parts. This in turn means that it is difficult to distribute the task of grammar writing across a team of linguists. Another difficulty is that as the grammar expands to cover a wider and wider range of constructions, there is a corresponding increase in the number of analyses which are admitted for any one sentence. In other words, ambiguity increases with coverage.

Despite these problems, some large collaborative projects have achieved interesting and impressive results in developing rule-based grammars for several languages. Examples are the Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) Pargram project, the Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) LinGO Matrix framework, and the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar XTAG Project.

6¬†¬†¬†Grammar Development

Parsing builds trees over sentences, according to a phrase structure grammar. Now, all the examples we gave above only involved toy grammars containing a handful of productions. What happens if we try to scale up this approach to deal with realistic corpora of language? In this section we will see how to access treebanks, and look at the challenge of developing broad-coverage grammars.

6.1¬†¬†¬†Treebanks and Grammars

The¬†corpus¬†module defines the¬†treebank¬†corpus reader, which contains a 10% sample of the Penn Treebank corpus.

¬†>>> from nltk.corpus import treebank >>> t = treebank.parsed_sents('wsj_0001.mrg')[0] >>> print(t) (S (NP-SBJ (NP (NNP Pierre) (NNP Vinken)) (, ,) (ADJP (NP (CD 61) (NNS years)) (JJ old)) (, ,)) (VP (MD will) (VP (VB join) (NP (DT the) (NN board)) (PP-CLR (IN as) (NP (DT a) (JJ nonexecutive) (NN director))) (NP-TMP (NNP Nov.) (CD 29)))) (. .))

We can use this data to help develop a grammar. For example, the program in¬†6.1¬†uses a simple filter to find verbs that take sentential complements. Assuming we already have a production of the form¬†VP -> Vs S, this information enables us to identify particular verbs that would be included in the expansion of¬†Vs.

¬†def filter(tree): child_nodes = [child.label() for child in tree if isinstance(child, nltk.Tree)] return (tree.label() == 'VP') and ('S' in child_nodes)¬†>>> from nltk.corpus import treebank >>> [subtree for tree in treebank.parsed_sents() ... for subtree in tree.subtrees(filter)] [Tree('VP', [Tree('VBN', ['named']), Tree('S', [Tree('NP-SBJ', ...]), ...]), ...]

Example 6.1 (code_sentential_complement.py):¬†Figure 6.1: Searching a Treebank to find Sentential Complements

The Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus,¬†nltk.corpus.ppattach¬†is another source of information about the valency of particular verbs. Here we illustrate a technique for mining this corpus. It finds pairs of prepositional phrases where the preposition and noun are fixed, but where the choice of verb determines whether the prepositional phrase is attached to the¬†VP¬†or to the¬†NP.

¬†>>> from collections import defaultdict >>> entries = nltk.corpus.ppattach.attachments('training') >>> table = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(set)) >>> for entry in entries: ... key = entry.noun1 + '-' + entry.prep + '-' + entry.noun2 ... table[key][entry.attachment].add(entry.verb) ... >>> for key in sorted(table): ... if len(table[key]) > 1: ... print(key, 'N:', sorted(table[key]['N']), 'V:', sorted(table[key]['V']))

Amongst the output lines of this program we find¬†offer-from-group N: ['rejected'] V: ['received'], which indicates that¬†received¬†expects a separate¬†PP¬†complement attached to the¬†VP, while¬†rejected¬†does not. As before, we can use this information to help construct the grammar.

The NLTK corpus collection includes data from the PE08 Cross-Framework and Cross Domain Parser Evaluation Shared Task. A collection of larger grammars has been prepared for the purpose of comparing different parsers, which can be obtained by downloading the¬†large_grammars¬†package (e.g.¬†python -m nltk.downloader large_grammars).

The NLTK corpus collection also includes a sample from the¬†Sinica Treebank Corpus, consisting of 10,000 parsed sentences drawn from the¬†Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese. Let's load and display one of the trees in this corpus.

¬†>>> nltk.corpus.sinica_treebank.parsed_sents()[3450].draw() 

Ôøº

6.2¬†¬†¬†Pernicious Ambiguity

Unfortunately, as the coverage of the grammar increases and the length of the input sentences grows, the number of parse trees grows rapidly. In fact, it grows at an astronomical rate.

Let's explore this issue with the help of a simple example. The word¬†fish¬†is both a noun and a verb. We can make up the sentence¬†fish fish fish, meaning¬†fish like to fish for other fish. (Try this with¬†police¬†if you prefer something more sensible.) Here is a toy grammar for the "fish" sentences.

¬†>>> grammar = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" ... S -> NP V NP ... NP -> NP Sbar ... Sbar -> NP V ... NP -> 'fish' ... V -> 'fish' ... """)

Now we can try parsing a longer sentence,¬†fish fish fish fish fish, which amongst other things, means 'fish that other fish fish are in the habit of fishing fish themselves'. We use the NLTK chart parser, which was mentioned earlier in this chapter. This sentence has two readings.

¬†>>> tokens = ["fish"] * 5 >>> cp = nltk.ChartParser(grammar) >>> for tree in cp.parse(tokens): ... print(tree) (S (NP fish) (V fish) (NP (NP fish) (Sbar (NP fish) (V fish)))) (S (NP (NP fish) (Sbar (NP fish) (V fish))) (V fish) (NP fish))

As the length of this sentence goes up (3, 5, 7, ...) we get the following numbers of parse trees: 1; 2; 5; 14; 42; 132; 429; 1,430; 4,862; 16,796; 58,786; 208,012; ... (These are the¬†Catalan numbers, which we saw in an exercise in¬†4). The last of these is for a sentence of length 23, the average length of sentences in the WSJ section of Penn Treebank. For a sentence of length 50 there would be over 1012¬†parses, and this is only half the length of the Piglet sentence (1), which young children process effortlessly. No practical NLP system could construct millions of trees for a sentence and choose the appropriate one in the context. It's clear that humans don't do this either!

Note that the problem is not with our choice of example.¬†(Church & Patil, 1982)¬†point out that the syntactic ambiguity of¬†PP¬†attachment in sentences like¬†(18)¬†also grows in proportion to the Catalan numbers.

(18)Put the block in the box on the table.

So much for structural ambiguity; what about lexical ambiguity? As soon as we try to construct a broad-coverage grammar, we are forced to make lexical entries highly ambiguous for their part of speech. In a toy grammar,¬†a¬†is only a determiner,¬†dog¬†is only a noun, and¬†runs¬†is only a verb. However, in a broad-coverage grammar,¬†a¬†is also a noun (e.g.¬†part a),¬†dog¬†is also a verb (meaning to follow closely), and¬†runs¬†is also a noun (e.g.¬†ski runs). In fact, all words can be referred to by name: e.g.¬†the verb 'ate' is spelled with three letters; in speech we do not need to supply quotation marks. Furthermore, it is possible to¬†verb¬†most nouns. Thus a parser for a broad-coverage grammar will be overwhelmed with ambiguity. Even complete gibberish will often have a reading, e.g.¬†the a are of I. As¬†(Klavans & Resnik, 1996)¬†has pointed out, this is not word salad but a grammatical noun phrase, in which¬†are¬†is a noun meaning a hundredth of a hectare (or 100 sq m), and¬†a¬†and¬†I¬†are nouns designating coordinates, as shown in¬†6.2.

Ôøº

Figure 6.2: "The a are of I": a schematic drawing of 27 paddocks, each being one "are" in size, and each identified using coordinates; the top left cell is the¬†a¬†"are" of column¬†I¬†(after Abney).

Even though this phrase is unlikely, it is still grammatical and a broad-coverage parser should be able to construct a parse tree for it. Similarly, sentences that seem to be unambiguous, such as¬†John saw Mary, turn out to have other readings we would not have anticipated (as Abney explains). This ambiguity is unavoidable, and leads to horrendous inefficiency in parsing seemingly innocuous sentences. The solution to these problems is provided by¬†probabilistic parsing, which allows us to¬†rank¬†the parses of an ambiguous sentence on the basis of evidence from corpora.

6.3¬†¬†¬†Weighted Grammar

As we have just seen, dealing with ambiguity is a key challenge in developing broad coverage parsers. Chart parsers improve the efficiency of computing multiple parses of the same sentences, but they are still overwhelmed by the sheer number of possible parses. Weighted grammars and probabilistic parsing algorithms have provided an effective solution to these problems.

Before looking at these, we need to understand why the notion of grammaticality could be¬†gradient. Considering the verb¬†give. This verb requires both a direct object (the thing being given) and an indirect object (the recipient). These complements can be given in either order, as illustrated in¬†(19). In the "prepositional dative" form in¬†(19a), the direct object appears first, followed by a prepositional phrase containing the indirect object.

(19)

a.Kim gave a bone to the dog

b.Kim gave the dog a bone

In the "double object" form in¬†(19b), the indirect object appears first, followed by the direct object. In the above case, either order is acceptable. However, if the indirect object is a pronoun, there is a strong preference for the double object construction:

(20)

a.Kim gives the heebie-jeebies to me (*prepositional dative)

b.Kim gives me the heebie-jeebies (double object)

Using the Penn Treebank sample, we can examine all instances of prepositional dative and double object constructions involving¬†give, as shown in¬†6.3.

¬†def give(t): return t.label() == 'VP' and len(t) > 2 and t[1].label() == 'NP'\ and (t[2].label() == 'PP-DTV' or t[2].label() == 'NP')\ and ('give' in t[0].leaves() or 'gave' in t[0].leaves()) def sent(t): return ' '.join(token for token in t.leaves() if token[0] not in '*-0') def print_node(t, width): output = "%s %s: %s / %s: %s" %\ (sent(t[0]), t[1].label(), sent(t[1]), t[2].label(), sent(t[2])) if len(output) > width: output = output[:width] + "..." print(output)¬†>>> for tree in nltk.corpus.treebank.parsed_sents(): ... for t in tree.subtrees(give): ... print_node(t, 72) gave NP: the chefs / NP: a standing ovation give NP: advertisers / NP: discounts for maintaining or increasing ad sp... give NP: it / PP-DTV: to the politicians gave NP: them / NP: similar help give NP: them / NP: give NP: only French history questions / PP-DTV: to students in a Europe... give NP: federal judges / NP: a raise give NP: consumers / NP: the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis gave NP: Mitsui / NP: access to a high-tech medical product give NP: Mitsubishi / NP: a window on the U.S. glass industry give NP: much thought / PP-DTV: to the rates she was receiving , nor to ... give NP: your Foster Savings Institution / NP: the gift of hope and free... give NP: market operators / NP: the authority to suspend trading in futu... gave NP: quick approval / PP-DTV: to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appr... give NP: the Transportation Department / NP: up to 50 days to review any... give NP: the president / NP: such power give NP: me / NP: the heebie-jeebies give NP: holders / NP: the right , but not the obligation , to buy a cal... gave NP: Mr. Thomas / NP: only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than ``... give NP: the president / NP: line-item veto power

Example 6.3 (code_give.py):¬†Figure 6.3: Usage of Give and Gave in the Penn Treebank sample

We can observe a strong tendency for the shortest complement to appear first. However, this does not account for a form like¬†give NP: federal judges / NP: a raise, where animacy may play a role. In fact there turn out to be a large number of contributing factors, as surveyed by¬†(Bresnan & Hay, 2006). Such preferences can be represented in a weighted grammar.

A¬†probabilistic context free grammar¬†(or¬†PCFG) is a context free grammar that associates a probability with each of its productions. It generates the same set of parses for a text that the corresponding context free grammar does, and assigns a probability to each parse. The probability of a parse generated by a PCFG is simply the product of the probabilities of the productions used to generate it.

The simplest way to define a PCFG is to load it from a specially formatted string consisting of a sequence of weighted productions, where weights appear in brackets, as shown in¬†6.4.

¬†grammar = nltk.PCFG.fromstring(""" S -> NP VP [1.0] VP -> TV NP [0.4] VP -> IV [0.3] VP -> DatV NP NP [0.3] TV -> 'saw' [1.0] IV -> 'ate' [1.0] DatV -> 'gave' [1.0] NP -> 'telescopes' [0.8] NP -> 'Jack' [0.2] """)¬†>>> print(grammar) Grammar with 9 productions (start state = S) S -> NP VP [1.0] VP -> TV NP [0.4] VP -> IV [0.3] VP -> DatV NP NP [0.3] TV -> 'saw' [1.0] IV -> 'ate' [1.0] DatV -> 'gave' [1.0] NP -> 'telescopes' [0.8] NP -> 'Jack' [0.2]

Example 6.4 (code_pcfg1.py):¬†Figure 6.4: Defining a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG)

It is sometimes convenient to combine multiple productions into a single line, e.g.¬†VP -> TV NP [0.4] | IV [0.3] | DatV NP NP [0.3]. In order to ensure that the trees generated by the grammar form a probability distribution, PCFG grammars impose the constraint that all productions with a given left-hand side must have probabilities that sum to one. The grammar in¬†6.4¬†obeys this constraint: for¬†S, there is only one production, with a probability of 1.0; for¬†VP, 0.4+0.3+0.3=1.0; and for¬†NP, 0.8+0.2=1.0. The parse tree returned by¬†parse()¬†includes probabilities:

¬†>>> viterbi_parser = nltk.ViterbiParser(grammar) >>> for tree in viterbi_parser.parse(['Jack', 'saw', 'telescopes']): ... print(tree) (S (NP Jack) (VP (TV saw) (NP telescopes))) (p=0.064)

Now that parse trees are assigned probabilities, it no longer matters that there may be a huge number of possible parses for a given sentence. A parser will be responsible for finding the most likely parses.

7¬†¬†¬†Summary

Sentences have internal organization that can be represented using a tree. Notable features of constituent structure are: recursion, heads, complements and modifiers.

A grammar is a compact characterization of a potentially infinite set of sentences; we say that a tree is well-formed according to a grammar, or that a grammar licenses a tree.

A grammar is a formal model for describing whether a given phrase can be assigned a particular constituent or dependency structure.

Given a set of syntactic categories, a context-free grammar uses a set of productions to say how a phrase of some category¬†A¬†can be analyzed into a sequence of smaller parts Œ±1¬†... Œ±n.

A dependency grammar uses productions to specify what the dependents are of a given lexical head.

Syntactic ambiguity arises when one sentence has more than one syntactic analysis (e.g. prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity).

A parser is a procedure for finding one or more trees corresponding to a grammatically well-formed sentence.

A simple top-down parser is the recursive descent parser, which recursively expands the start symbol (usually¬†S) with the help of the grammar productions, and tries to match the input sentence. This parser cannot handle left-recursive productions (e.g., productions such as¬†NP -> NP PP). It is inefficient in the way it blindly expands categories without checking whether they are compatible with the input string, and in repeatedly expanding the same non-terminals and discarding the results.

A simple bottom-up parser is the shift-reduce parser, which shifts input onto a stack and tries to match the items at the top of the stack with the right hand side of grammar productions. This parser is not guaranteed to find a valid parse for the input even if one exists, and builds substructure without checking whether it is globally consistent with the grammar.

There are many introductory books on syntax.¬†(O'Grady et al, 2004)¬†is a general introduction to linguistics, while¬†(Radford, 1988)¬†provides a gentle introduction to transformational grammar, and can be recommended for its coverage of transformational approaches to unbounded dependency constructions. The most widely used term in linguistics for formal grammar is¬†generative grammar, though it has nothing to do with generation¬†(Chomsky, 1965). The framework of X-bar Syntax is due to¬†(Jacobs & Rosenbaum, 1970), and is explored at greater length in¬†(Jackendoff, 1977)¬†(The primes we use replace Chomsky's typographically more demanding horizontal bars.)

(Burton-Roberts, 1997)¬†is a practically oriented textbook on how to analyze constituency in English, with extensive exemplification and exercises.¬†(Huddleston & Pullum, 2002)¬†provides an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of syntactic phenomena in English.

Chapter 12 of¬†(Jurafsky & Martin, 2008)¬†covers formal grammars of English; Sections 13.1-3 cover simple parsing algorithms and techniques for dealing with ambiguity; Chapter 14 covers statistical parsing; Chapter 16 covers the Chomsky hierarchy and the formal complexity of natural language.¬†(Levin, 1993)¬†has categorized English verbs into fine-grained classes, according to their syntactic properties.

There are several ongoing efforts to build large-scale rule-based grammars, e.g. the LFG Pargram project¬†http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/nltt/pargram/, the HPSG LinGO Matrix framework¬†http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/¬†and the XTAG Project¬†http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/.

9¬†¬†¬†Exercises

‚òº Can you come up with grammatical sentences that have probably never been uttered before? (Take turns with a partner.) What does this tell you about human language?

‚òº Recall Strunk and White's prohibition against sentence-initial¬†however¬†used to mean "although". Do a web search for¬†however¬†used at the start of the sentence. How widely used is this construction?

‚òº Consider the sentence¬†Kim arrived or Dana left and everyone cheered. Write down the parenthesized forms to show the relative scope of¬†and¬†and¬†or. Generate tree structures corresponding to both of these interpretations.

‚òº The¬†Tree¬†class implements a variety of other useful methods. See the¬†Tree¬†help documentation for more details, i.e. import the Tree class and then type¬†help(Tree).

‚òº In this exercise you will manually construct some parse trees.

Write code to produce two trees, one for each reading of the phrase¬†old men and women

Encode any of the trees presented in this chapter as a labeled bracketing and use¬†nltk.Tree()¬†to check that it is well-formed. Now use¬†draw()¬†to display the tree.

As in (a) above, draw a tree for¬†The woman saw a man last Thursday.

‚òº Write a recursive function to traverse a tree and return the depth of the tree, such that a tree with a single node would have depth zero. (Hint: the depth of a subtree is the maximum depth of its children, plus one.)

‚òº Analyze the A.A. Milne sentence about Piglet, by underlining all of the sentences it contains then replacing these with¬†S¬†(e.g. the first sentence becomes¬†S¬†when:lx`¬†S). Draw a tree structure for this "compressed" sentence. What are the main syntactic constructions used for building such a long sentence?

‚òº In the recursive descent parser demo, experiment with changing the sentence to be parsed by selecting¬†Edit Text¬†in the¬†Edit¬†menu.

‚òº Can the grammar in¬†grammar1¬†be used to describe sentences that are more than 20 words in length?

‚òº Use the graphical chart-parser interface to experiment with different rule invocation strategies. Come up with your own strategy that you can execute manually using the graphical interface. Describe the steps, and report any efficiency improvements it has (e.g. in terms of the size of the resulting chart). Do these improvements depend on the structure of the grammar? What do you think of the prospects for significant performance boosts from cleverer rule invocation strategies?

‚òº With pen and paper, manually trace the execution of a recursive descent parser and a shift-reduce parser, for a CFG you have already seen, or one of your own devising.

‚òº We have seen that a chart parser adds but never removes edges from a chart. Why?

‚òº Consider the sequence of words:¬†Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo. This is a grammatically correct sentence, as explained at¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo.¬†Consider the tree diagram presented on this Wikipedia page, and write down a suitable grammar. Normalize case to lowercase, to simulate the problem that a listener has when hearing this sentence. Can you find other parses for this sentence? How does the number of parse trees grow as the sentence gets longer? (More examples of these sentences can be found at¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homophonous_phrases).

‚óë You can modify the grammar in the recursive descent parser demo by selecting¬†Edit Grammar¬†in the¬†Edit¬†menu. Change the second expansion production, namely¬†NP -> Det N PP, to¬†NP -> NP PP. Using the¬†Step¬†button, try to build a parse tree. What happens?

‚óë Extend the grammar in¬†grammar2¬†with productions that expand prepositions as intransitive, transitive and requiring a¬†PP¬†complement. Based on these productions, use the method of the preceding exercise to draw a tree for the sentence¬†Lee ran away home.

‚óë Pick some common verbs and complete the following tasks:

Write a program to find those verbs in the Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus¬†nltk.corpus.ppattach. Find any cases where the same verb exhibits two different attachments, but where the first noun, or second noun, or preposition, stay unchanged (as we saw in our discussion of syntactic ambiguity in¬†2).

Devise CFG grammar productions to cover some of these cases.

‚óë Write a program to compare the efficiency of a top-down chart parser compared with a recursive descent parser (4). Use the same grammar and input sentences for both. Compare their performance using the¬†timeit¬†module (see¬†4.7¬†for an example of how to do this).

‚óë Compare the performance of the top-down, bottom-up, and left-corner parsers using the same grammar and three grammatical test sentences. Use¬†timeit¬†to log the amount of time each parser takes on the same sentence. Write a function that runs all three parsers on all three sentences, and prints a 3-by-3 grid of times, as well as row and column totals. Discuss your findings.

‚óë Read up on "garden path" sentences. How might the computational work of a parser relate to the difficulty humans have with processing these sentences?¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence

‚óë To compare multiple trees in a single window, we can use the¬†draw_trees()¬†method. Define some trees and try it out:

¬†>>> from nltk.draw.tree import draw_trees >>> draw_trees(tree1, tree2, tree3) 

‚óë Using tree positions, list the subjects of the first 100 sentences in the Penn treebank; to make the results easier to view, limit the extracted subjects to subtrees whose height is 2.

‚óë Inspect the Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus and try to suggest some factors that influence¬†PP¬†attachment.

‚óë In this section we claimed that there are linguistic regularities that cannot be described simply in terms of n-grams. Consider the following sentence, particularly the position of the phrase¬†in his turn. Does this illustrate a problem for an approach based on n-grams?

What was more, the in his turn somewhat youngish Nikolay Parfenovich also turned out to be the only person in the entire world to acquire a sincere liking to our "discriminated-against" public procurator.¬†(Dostoevsky: The Brothers Karamazov)

‚óë Write a recursive function that produces a nested bracketing for a tree, leaving out the leaf nodes, and displaying the non-terminal labels after their subtrees. So the above example about Pierre Vinken would produce:¬†[[[NNP NNP]NP , [ADJP [CD NNS]NP JJ]ADJP ,]NP-SBJ MD [VB [DT NN]NP [IN [DT JJ NN]NP]PP-CLR [NNP CD]NP-TMP]VP .]S¬†Consecutive categories should be separated by space.

‚óë Download several electronic books from Project Gutenberg. Write a program to scan these texts for any extremely long sentences. What is the longest sentence you can find? What syntactic construction(s) are responsible for such long sentences?

‚óë Modify the functions¬†init_wfst()¬†and¬†complete_wfst()¬†so that the contents of each cell in the WFST is a set of non-terminal symbols rather than a single non-terminal.

‚óë Consider the algorithm in¬†4.4. Can you explain why parsing context-free grammar is proportional to¬†n3, where¬†n¬†is the length of the input sentence.

‚óë Process each tree of the Treebank corpus sample¬†nltk.corpus.treebank¬†and extract the productions with the help of¬†Tree.productions(). Discard the productions that occur only once. Productions with the same left hand side, and similar right hand sides can be collapsed, resulting in an equivalent but more compact set of rules. Write code to output a compact grammar.

‚òÖ One common way of defining the subject of a sentence¬†S¬†in English is as¬†the noun phrase that is the child of¬†S¬†and the sibling of¬†VP. Write a function that takes the tree for a sentence and returns the subtree corresponding to the subject of the sentence. What should it do if the root node of the tree passed to this function is not¬†S, or it lacks a subject?

‚òÖ Write a function that takes a grammar (such as the one defined in¬†3.1) and returns a random sentence generated by the grammar. (Use¬†grammar.start()¬†to find the start symbol of the grammar;¬†grammar.productions(lhs)¬†to get the list of productions from the grammar that have the specified left-hand side; and¬†production.rhs()¬†to get the right-hand side of a production.)

‚òÖ Implement a version of the shift-reduce parser using backtracking, so that it finds all possible parses for a sentence, what might be called a "recursive ascent parser." Consult the Wikipedia entry for backtracking at¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking

‚òÖ As we saw in¬†7., it is possible to collapse chunks down to their chunk label. When we do this for sentences involving the word¬†gave, we find patterns such as the following:

gave NP gave up NP in NP gave NP up gave NP NP gave NP to NP 

Use this method to study the complementation patterns of a verb of interest, and write suitable grammar productions. (This task is sometimes called¬†lexical acquisition.)

Identify some English verbs that are near-synonyms, such as the¬†dumped/filled/loaded¬†example from earlier in this chapter. Use the chunking method to study the complementation patterns of these verbs. Create a grammar to cover these cases. Can the verbs be freely substituted for each other, or are their constraints? Discuss your findings.

‚òÖ Develop a left-corner parser based on the recursive descent parser, and inheriting from¬†ParseI.

‚òÖ Extend NLTK's shift-reduce parser to incorporate backtracking, so that it is guaranteed to find all parses that exist (i.e. it is¬†complete).

‚òÖ Modify the functions¬†init_wfst()¬†and¬†complete_wfst()¬†so that when a non-terminal symbol is added to a cell in the WFST, it includes a record of the cells from which it was derived. Implement a function that will convert a WFST in this form to a parse tree.

8. Analyzing Sentence Structure

Earlier chapters focused on words: how to identify them, analyze their structure, assign them to lexical categories, and access their meanings. We have also seen how to identify patterns in word sequences or n-grams. However, these methods only scratch the surface of the complex constraints that govern sentences. We need a way to deal with the ambiguity that natural language is famous for. We also need to be able to cope with the fact that there are an unlimited number of possible sentences, and we can only write finite programs to analyze their structures and discover their meanings.

The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:

How can we use a formal grammar to describe the structure of an unlimited set of sentences?

How do we represent the structure of sentences using syntax trees?

How do parsers analyze a sentence and automatically build a syntax tree?

Along the way, we will cover the fundamentals of English syntax, and see that there are systematic aspects of meaning that are much easier to capture once we have identified the structure of sentences.

1¬†¬†¬†Some Grammatical Dilemmas

1.1¬†¬†¬†Linguistic Data and Unlimited Possibilities

Previous chapters have shown you how to process and analyse text corpora, and we have stressed the challenges for NLP in dealing with the vast amount of electronic language data that is growing daily. Let's consider this data more closely, and make the thought experiment that we have a gigantic corpus consisting of everything that has been either uttered or written in English over, say, the last 50 years. Would we be justified in calling this corpus "the language of modern English"? There are a number of reasons why we might answer No. Recall that in¬†3, we asked you to search the web for instances of the pattern¬†the of. Although it is easy to find examples on the web containing this word sequence, such as¬†New man at the of IMG¬†(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2387900/New-man-at-the-of-IMG.html), speakers of English will say that most such examples are errors, and therefore not part of English after all.

Accordingly, we can argue that the "modern English" is not equivalent to the very big set of word sequences in our imaginary corpus. Speakers of English can make judgements about these sequences, and will reject some of them as being ungrammatical.

Equally, it is easy to compose a new sentence and have speakers agree that it is perfectly good English. For example, sentences have an interesting property that they can be embedded inside larger sentences. Consider the following sentences:

(1)

a.Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

b.The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

c.Andre said The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

d.I think Andre said the Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record

If we replaced whole sentences with the symbol¬†S, we would see patterns like¬†Andre said¬†S¬†and¬†I think¬†S. These are templates for taking a sentence and constructing a bigger sentence. There are other templates we can use, like¬†S¬†but¬†S, and¬†S¬†when¬†S. With a bit of ingenuity we can construct some really long sentences using these templates. Here's an impressive example from a Winnie the Pooh story by A.A. Milne,¬†In which Piglet is Entirely Surrounded by Water:

[You can imagine Piglet's joy when at last the ship came in sight of him.] In after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very Great Danger during the Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had really been in was the last half-hour of his imprisonment, when Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort him, and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid a seagull's egg by mistake, and the story went on and on, rather like this sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his window without much hope, went to sleep quietly and naturally, slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until he was only hanging on by his toes, at which moment, luckily, a sudden loud squawk from Owl, which was really part of the story, being what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself back into safety and say, "How interesting, and did she?" when ‚Äî well, you can imagine his joy when at last he saw the good ship, Brain of Pooh (Captain, C. Robin; 1st Mate, P. Bear) coming over the sea to rescue him...

This long sentence actually has a simple structure that begins¬†S but S when S. We can see from this example that language provides us with constructions which seem to allow us to extend sentences indefinitely. It is also striking that we can understand sentences of arbitrary length that we've never heard before: it's not hard to concoct an entirely novel sentence, one that has probably never been used before in the history of the language, yet all speakers of the language will understand it.

The purpose of a grammar is to give an explicit description of a language. But the way in which we think of a grammar is closely intertwined with what we consider to be a language. Is it a large but finite set of observed utterances and written texts? Is it something more abstract like the implicit knowledge that competent speakers have about grammatical sentences? Or is it some combination of the two? We won't take a stand on this issue, but instead will introduce the main approaches.

In this chapter, we will adopt the formal framework of "generative grammar", in which a "language" is considered to be nothing more than an enormous collection of all grammatical sentences, and a grammar is a formal notation that can be used for "generating" the members of this set. Grammars use recursive¬†productions¬†of the form¬†S¬†‚Üí¬†S¬†and¬†S, as we will explore in¬†3. In¬†10.¬†we will extend this, to automatically build up the meaning of a sentence out of the meanings of its parts.

1.2¬†¬†¬†Ubiquitous Ambiguity

A well-known example of ambiguity is shown in¬†(2), from the Groucho Marx movie,¬†Animal Crackers¬†(1930):

(2)While hunting in Africa, I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas, I don't know.

Let's take a closer look at the ambiguity in the phrase:¬†I shot an elephant in my pajamas. First we need to define a simple grammar:

¬†>>> groucho_grammar = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" ... S -> NP VP ... PP -> P NP ... NP -> Det N | Det N PP | 'I' ... VP -> V NP | VP PP ... Det -> 'an' | 'my' ... N -> 'elephant' | 'pajamas' ... V -> 'shot' ... P -> 'in' ... """)

This grammar permits the sentence to be analyzed in two ways, depending on whether the prepositional phrase¬†in my pajamas¬†describes the elephant or the shooting event.

¬†>>> sent = ['I', 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas'] >>> parser = nltk.ChartParser(groucho_grammar) >>> for tree in parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) ... (S (NP I) (VP (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant))) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))) (S (NP I) (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))))

The program produces two bracketed structures, which we can depict as trees, as shown in¬†(3b):

(3)

a.Ôøº

b.Ôøº

Notice that there's no ambiguity concerning the meaning of any of the words; e.g. the word¬†shot¬†doesn't refer to the act of using a gun in the first sentence, and using a camera in the second sentence.

Note

Your Turn:¬†Consider the following sentences and see if you can think of two quite different interpretations:¬†Fighting animals could be dangerous.¬†Visiting relatives can be tiresome.¬†Is ambiguity of the individual words to blame? If not, what is the cause of the ambiguity?

This chapter presents grammars and parsing, as the formal and computational methods for investigating and modeling the linguistic phenomena we have been discussing. As we shall see, patterns of well-formedness and ill-formedness in a sequence of words can be understood with respect to the phrase structure and dependencies. We can develop formal models of these structures using grammars and parsers. As before, a key motivation is natural language¬†understanding. How much more of the meaning of a text can we access when we can reliably recognize the linguistic structures it contains? Having read in a text, can a program "understand" it enough to be able to answer simple questions about "what happened" or "who did what to whom"? Also as before, we will develop simple programs to process annotated corpora and perform useful tasks.

2¬†¬†¬†What's the Use of Syntax?

2.1¬†¬†¬†Beyond n-grams

We gave an example in¬†2.¬†of how to use the frequency information in bigrams to generate text that seems perfectly acceptable for small sequences of words but rapidly degenerates into nonsense. Here's another pair of examples that we created by computing the bigrams over the text of a childrens' story,¬†The Adventures of Buster Brown¬†(http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22816/22816.txt):

(4)

a.He roared with me the pail slip down his back

b.The worst part and clumsy looking for whoever heard light

You intuitively know that these sequences are "word-salad", but you probably find it hard to pin down what's wrong with them. One benefit of studying grammar is that it provides a conceptual framework and vocabulary for spelling out these intuitions. Let's take a closer look at the sequence¬†the worst part and clumsy looking. This looks like a¬†coordinate structure, where two phrases are joined by a coordinating conjunction such as¬†and,¬†but¬†or¬†or. Here's an informal (and simplified) statement of how coordination works syntactically:

Coordinate Structure:

If¬†v1¬†and¬†v2¬†are both phrases of grammatical category¬†X, then¬†v1¬†and¬†v2¬†is also a phrase of category¬†X.

Here are a couple of examples. In the first, two¬†NPs (noun phrases) have been conjoined to make an¬†NP, while in the second, two¬†APs (adjective phrases) have been conjoined to make an¬†AP.

(5)

a.The book's ending was (NP¬†the worst part and the best part) for me.

b.On land they are (AP¬†slow and clumsy looking).

What we¬†can't¬†do is conjoin an¬†NP¬†and an¬†AP, which is why¬†the worst part and clumsy looking¬†is ungrammatical. Before we can formalize these ideas, we need to understand the concept of¬†constituent structure.

Constituent structure is based on the observation that words combine with other words to form units. The evidence that a sequence of words forms such a unit is given by substitutability ‚Äî that is, a sequence of words in a well-formed sentence can be replaced by a shorter sequence without rendering the sentence ill-formed. To clarify this idea, consider the following sentence:

(6)The little bear saw the fine fat trout in the brook.

The fact that we can substitute¬†He¬†for¬†The little bear¬†indicates that the latter sequence is a unit. By contrast, we cannot replace¬†little bear saw¬†in the same way.

(7)

a.He saw the fine fat trout in the brook.

b.*The he the fine fat trout in the brook.

In¬†2.1, we systematically substitute longer sequences by shorter ones in a way which preserves grammaticality. Each sequence that forms a unit can in fact be replaced by a single word, and we end up with just two elements.

Ôøº

Figure 2.1: Substitution of Word Sequences: working from the top row, we can replace particular sequences of words (e.g.¬†the brook) with individual words (e.g.¬†it); repeating this process we arrive at a grammatical two-word sentence.

In¬†2.2, we have added grammatical category labels to the words we saw in the earlier figure. The labels¬†NP,¬†VP, and¬†PP¬†stand for¬†noun phrase,¬†verb phrase¬†and¬†prepositional phrase¬†respectively.

Ôøº

Figure 2.2: Substitution of Word Sequences Plus Grammatical Categories: This diagram reproduces¬†2.1¬†along with grammatical categories corresponding to noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), prepositional phrases (PP), and nominals (Nom).

If we now strip out the words apart from the topmost row, add an¬†S¬†node, and flip the figure over, we end up with a standard phrase structure tree, shown in¬†(8). Each node in this tree (including the words) is called a¬†constituent. The¬†immediate constituents¬†of¬†S¬†are¬†NP¬†and¬†VP.

(8)Ôøº

As we will see in the next section, a grammar specifies how the sentence can be subdivided into its immediate constituents, and how these can be further subdivided until we reach the level of individual words.

Note

As we saw in¬†1, sentences can have arbitrary length. Consequently, phrase structure trees can have arbitrary¬†depth. The cascaded chunk parsers we saw in¬†4¬†can only produce structures of bounded depth, so chunking methods aren't applicable here.

3¬†¬†¬†Context Free Grammar

3.1¬†¬†¬†A Simple Grammar

Let's start off by looking at a simple context-free grammar. By convention, the left-hand-side of the first production is the¬†start-symbol¬†of the grammar, typically¬†S, and all well-formed trees must have this symbol as their root label. In NLTK, context-free grammars are defined in the¬†nltk.grammar¬†module. In¬†3.1¬†we define a grammar and show how to parse a simple sentence admitted by the grammar.

¬†grammar1 = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" S -> NP VP VP -> V NP | V NP PP PP -> P NP V -> "saw" | "ate" | "walked" NP -> "John" | "Mary" | "Bob" | Det N | Det N PP Det -> "a" | "an" | "the" | "my" N -> "man" | "dog" | "cat" | "telescope" | "park" P -> "in" | "on" | "by" | "with" """)¬†>>> sent = "Mary saw Bob".split() >>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> for tree in rd_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP Bob)))

Example 3.1 (code_cfg1.py):¬†Figure 3.1: A Simple Context-Free Grammar

The grammar in¬†3.1¬†contains productions involving various syntactic categories, as laid out in¬†3.1.

Table 3.1:

A production like¬†VP -> V NP | V NP PP¬†has a disjunction on the righthand side, shown by the¬†|¬†and is an abbreviation for the two productions¬†VP -> V NP¬†and¬†VP -> V NP PP.

Ôøº

Figure 3.2: Recursive Descent Parser Demo: This tool allows you to watch the operation of a recursive descent parser as it grows the parse tree and matches it against the input words.

Note

Your Turn:¬†Try developing a simple grammar of your own, using the recursive descent parser application,¬†nltk.app.rdparser(), shown in¬†3.2. It comes already loaded with a sample grammar, but you can edit this as you please (using the¬†Edit¬†menu). Change the grammar, and the sentence to be parsed, and run the parser using the¬†autostep¬†button.

If we parse the sentence¬†The dog saw a man in the park¬†using the grammar shown in¬†3.1, we end up with two trees, similar to those we saw for¬†(3b):

(9)

a.Ôøº

b.Ôøº

Since our grammar licenses two trees for this sentence, the sentence is said to be¬†structurally ambiguous. The ambiguity in question is called a¬†prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity, as we saw earlier in this chapter. As you may recall, it is an ambiguity about attachment since the¬†PP¬†in the park¬†needs to be attached to one of two places in the tree: either as a child of¬†VP¬†or else as a child of¬†NP. When the¬†PP¬†is attached to¬†VP, the intended interpretation is that the seeing event happened in the park. However, if the¬†PP¬†is attached to¬†NP, then it was the man who was in the park, and the agent of the seeing (the dog) might have been sitting on the balcony of an apartment overlooking the park.

3.2¬†¬†¬†Writing Your Own Grammars

If you are interested in experimenting with writing CFGs, you will find it helpful to create and edit your grammar in a text file, say¬†mygrammar.cfg. You can then load it into NLTK and parse with it as follows:

¬†>>> grammar1 = nltk.data.load('file:mygrammar.cfg') >>> sent = "Mary saw Bob".split() >>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> for tree in rd_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree)

Make sure that you put a¬†.cfg¬†suffix on the filename, and that there are no spaces in the string¬†'file:mygrammar.cfg'. If the command¬†print(tree)¬†produces no output, this is probably because your sentence¬†sent¬†is not admitted by your grammar. In this case, call the parser with tracing set to be on:¬†rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1, trace=2). You can also check what productions are currently in the grammar with the command¬†for¬†p¬†in¬†grammar1.productions():¬†print(p).

When you write CFGs for parsing in NLTK, you cannot combine grammatical categories with lexical items on the righthand side of the same production. Thus, a production such as¬†PP ->¬†'of'¬†NP¬†is disallowed. In addition, you are not permitted to place multi-word lexical items on the righthand side of a production. So rather than writing¬†NP ->¬†'New¬†York', you have to resort to something like¬†NP ->¬†'New_York'¬†instead.

3.3¬†¬†¬†Recursion in Syntactic Structure

A grammar is said to be¬†recursive¬†if a category occurring on the left hand side of a production also appears on the righthand side of a production, as illustrated in¬†3.3. The production¬†Nom -> Adj Nom¬†(where¬†Nom¬†is the category of nominals) involves direct recursion on the category¬†Nom, whereas indirect recursion on¬†S¬†arises from the combination of two productions, namely¬†S -> NP VP¬†and¬†VP -> V S.

¬†grammar2 = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" S -> NP VP NP -> Det Nom | PropN Nom -> Adj Nom | N VP -> V Adj | V NP | V S | V NP PP PP -> P NP PropN -> 'Buster' | 'Chatterer' | 'Joe' Det -> 'the' | 'a' N -> 'bear' | 'squirrel' | 'tree' | 'fish' | 'log' Adj -> 'angry' | 'frightened' | 'little' | 'tall' V -> 'chased' | 'saw' | 'said' | 'thought' | 'was' | 'put' P -> 'on' """)

Example 3.3 (code_cfg2.py):¬†Figure 3.3: A Recursive Context-Free Grammar

To see how recursion arises from this grammar, consider the following trees.¬†(10a)¬†involves nested nominal phrases, while¬†(10b)¬†contains nested sentences.

(10)

a.Ôøº

b.Ôøº

We've only illustrated two levels of recursion here, but there's no upper limit on the depth. You can experiment with parsing sentences that involve more deeply nested structures. Beware that the¬†RecursiveDescentParser¬†is unable to handle¬†left-recursive¬†productions of the form¬†X -> X Y; we will return to this in¬†4.

4¬†¬†¬†Parsing With Context Free Grammar

A¬†parser¬†processes input sentences according to the productions of a grammar, and builds one or more constituent structures that conform to the grammar. A grammar is a declarative specification of well-formedness ‚Äî it is actually just a string, not a program. A parser is a procedural interpretation of the grammar. It searches through the space of trees licensed by a grammar to find one that has the required sentence along its fringe.

A parser permits a grammar to be evaluated against a collection of test sentences, helping linguists to discover mistakes in their grammatical analysis. A parser can serve as a model of psycholinguistic processing, helping to explain the difficulties that humans have with processing certain syntactic constructions. Many natural language applications involve parsing at some point; for example, we would expect the natural language questions submitted to a question-answering system to undergo parsing as an initial step.

In this section we see two simple parsing algorithms, a top-down method called recursive descent parsing, and a bottom-up method called shift-reduce parsing. We also see some more sophisticated algorithms, a top-down method with bottom-up filtering called left-corner parsing, and a dynamic programming technique called chart parsing.

4.1¬†¬†¬†Recursive Descent Parsing

The simplest kind of parser interprets a grammar as a specification of how to break a high-level goal into several lower-level subgoals. The top-level goal is to find an¬†S. The¬†S¬†‚Üí¬†NP VP¬†production permits the parser to replace this goal with two subgoals: find an¬†NP, then find a¬†VP. Each of these subgoals can be replaced in turn by sub-sub-goals, using productions that have¬†NP¬†and¬†VP¬†on their left-hand side. Eventually, this expansion process leads to subgoals such as: find the word¬†telescope. Such subgoals can be directly compared against the input sequence, and succeed if the next word is matched. If there is no match the parser must back up and try a different alternative.

The recursive descent parser builds a parse tree during the above process. With the initial goal (find an¬†S), the¬†S¬†root node is created. As the above process recursively expands its goals using the productions of the grammar, the parse tree is extended downwards (hence the name¬†recursive descent). We can see this in action using the graphical demonstration¬†nltk.app.rdparser(). Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in¬†4.1.

Ôøº

Figure 4.1: Six Stages of a Recursive Descent Parser: the parser begins with a tree consisting of the node¬†S; at each stage it consults the grammar to find a production that can be used to enlarge the tree; when a lexical production is encountered, its word is compared against the input; after a complete parse has been found, the parser backtracks to look for more parses.

During this process, the parser is often forced to choose between several possible productions. For example, in going from step 3 to step 4, it tries to find productions with¬†N¬†on the left-hand side. The first of these is¬†N¬†‚Üí¬†man. When this does not work it¬†backtracks, and tries other¬†N¬†productions in order, until it gets to¬†N¬†‚Üí¬†dog, which matches the next word in the input sentence. Much later, as shown in step 5, it finds a complete parse. This is a tree that covers the entire sentence, without any dangling edges. Once a parse has been found, we can get the parser to look for additional parses. Again it will backtrack and explore other choices of production in case any of them result in a parse.

NLTK provides a recursive descent parser:

¬†>>> rd_parser = nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> sent = 'Mary saw a dog'.split() >>> for tree in rd_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog))))

Note

RecursiveDescentParser()¬†takes an optional parameter¬†trace. If¬†trace¬†is greater than zero, then the parser will report the steps that it takes as it parses a text.

Recursive descent parsing has three key shortcomings. First, left-recursive productions like¬†NP -> NP PP¬†send it into an infinite loop. Second, the parser wastes a lot of time considering words and structures that do not correspond to the input sentence. Third, the backtracking process may discard parsed constituents that will need to be rebuilt again later. For example, backtracking over¬†VP -> V NP¬†will discard the subtree created for the¬†NP. If the parser then proceeds with¬†VP -> V NP PP, then the¬†NP¬†subtree must be created all over again.

Recursive descent parsing is a kind of¬†top-down parsing. Top-down parsers use a grammar to¬†predict¬†what the input will be, before inspecting the input! However, since the input is available to the parser all along, it would be more sensible to consider the input sentence from the very beginning. This approach is called¬†bottom-up parsing, and we will see an example in the next section.

4.2¬†¬†¬†Shift-Reduce Parsing

A simple kind of bottom-up parser is the¬†shift-reduce parser. In common with all bottom-up parsers, a shift-reduce parser tries to find sequences of words and phrases that correspond to the¬†right hand¬†side of a grammar production, and replace them with the left-hand side, until the whole sentence is reduced to an¬†S.

The shift-reduce parser repeatedly pushes the next input word onto a stack (4.1); this is the¬†shift¬†operation. If the top¬†n¬†items on the stack match the¬†n¬†items on the right hand side of some production, then they are all popped off the stack, and the item on the left-hand side of the production is pushed on the stack. This replacement of the top¬†n¬†items with a single item is the¬†reduce¬†operation. This operation may only be applied to the top of the stack; reducing items lower in the stack must be done before later items are pushed onto the stack. The parser finishes when all the input is consumed and there is only one item remaining on the stack, a parse tree with an¬†S¬†node as its root. The shift-reduce parser builds a parse tree during the above process. Each time it pops¬†n¬†items off the stack it combines them into a partial parse tree, and pushes this back on the stack. We can see the shift-reduce parsing algorithm in action using the graphical demonstration¬†nltk.app.srparser(). Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in¬†4.2.

Ôøº

Figure 4.2: Six Stages of a Shift-Reduce Parser: the parser begins by shifting the first input word onto its stack; once the top items on the stack match the right hand side of a grammar production, they can be replaced with the left hand side of that production; the parser succeeds once all input is consumed and one¬†S¬†item remains on the stack.

NLTK provides¬†ShiftReduceParser(), a simple implementation of a shift-reduce parser. This parser does not implement any backtracking, so it is not guaranteed to find a parse for a text, even if one exists. Furthermore, it will only find at most one parse, even if more parses exist. We can provide an optional¬†trace¬†parameter that controls how verbosely the parser reports the steps that it takes as it parses a text:

¬†>>> sr_parser = nltk.ShiftReduceParser(grammar1) >>> sent = 'Mary saw a dog'.split() >>> for tree in sr_parser.parse(sent): ... print(tree) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog))))

Note

Your Turn:¬†Run the above parser in tracing mode to see the sequence of shift and reduce operations, using¬†sr_parse = nltk.ShiftReduceParser(grammar1, trace=2)

A shift-reduce parser can reach a dead end and fail to find any parse, even if the input sentence is well-formed according to the grammar. When this happens, no input remains, and the stack contains items which cannot be reduced to an¬†S. The problem arises because there are choices made earlier that cannot be undone by the parser (although users of the graphical demonstration can undo their choices). There are two kinds of choices to be made by the parser: (a) which reduction to do when more than one is possible (b) whether to shift or reduce when either action is possible.

A shift-reduce parser may be extended to implement policies for resolving such conflicts. For example, it may address shift-reduce conflicts by shifting only when no reductions are possible, and it may address reduce-reduce conflicts by favoring the reduction operation that removes the most items from the stack. (A generalization of shift-reduce parser, a "lookahead LR parser", is commonly used in programming language compilers.)

The advantage of shift-reduce parsers over recursive descent parsers is that they only build structure that corresponds to the words in the input. Furthermore, they only build each sub-structure once, e.g.¬†NP(Det(the), N(man))¬†is only built and pushed onto the stack a single time, regardless of whether it will later be used by the¬†VP -> V NP PP¬†reduction or the¬†NP -> NP PP¬†reduction.

4.3¬†¬†¬†The Left-Corner Parser

One of the problems with the recursive descent parser is that it goes into an infinite loop when it encounters a left-recursive production. This is because it applies the grammar productions blindly, without considering the actual input sentence. A left-corner parser is a hybrid between the bottom-up and top-down approaches we have seen.

Grammar¬†grammar1¬†allows us to produce the following parse of¬†John saw Mary:

(11)Ôøº

Recall that the grammar (defined in¬†3.3) has the following productions for expanding¬†NP:

(12)

a.NP -> Det N

b.NP -> Det N PP

c.NP ->¬†"John"¬†|¬†"Mary"¬†|¬†"Bob"

Suppose we ask you to first look at tree¬†(11), and then decide which of the¬†NP¬†productions you'd want a recursive descent parser to apply first ‚Äî obviously,¬†(12c)¬†is the right choice! How do you know that it would be pointless to apply¬†(12a)¬†or¬†(12b)¬†instead? Because neither of these productions will derive a sequence whose first word is¬†John. That is, we can easily tell that in a successful parse of¬†John saw Mary, the parser has to expand¬†NP¬†in such a way that¬†NP¬†derives the sequence¬†John¬†Œ±. More generally, we say that a category¬†B¬†is a¬†left-corner¬†of a tree rooted in¬†A¬†if¬†A¬†‚áí*¬†B¬†Œ±.

(13)Ôøº

A¬†left-corner parser¬†is a top-down parser with bottom-up filtering. Unlike an ordinary recursive descent parser, it does not get trapped in left recursive productions. Before starting its work, a left-corner parser preprocesses the context-free grammar to build a table where each row contains two cells, the first holding a non-terminal, and the second holding the collection of possible left corners of that non-terminal.¬†4.1¬†illustrates this for the grammar from¬†grammar2.

Table 4.1:

Left-Corners in¬†grammar2

CategoryLeft-Corners (pre-terminals)SNPNPDet, PropNVPVPPP

Each time a production is considered by the parser, it checks that the next input word is compatible with at least one of the pre-terminal categories in the left-corner table.

4.4¬†¬†¬†Well-Formed Substring Tables

The simple parsers discussed above suffer from limitations in both completeness and efficiency. In order to remedy these, we will apply the algorithm design technique of¬†dynamic programming¬†to the parsing problem. As we saw in¬†4.7, dynamic programming stores intermediate results and re-uses them when appropriate, achieving significant efficiency gains. This technique can be applied to syntactic parsing, allowing us to store partial solutions to the parsing task and then look them up as necessary in order to efficiently arrive at a complete solution. This approach to parsing is known as¬†chart parsing. We introduce the main idea in this section; see the online materials available for this chapter for more implementation details.

Dynamic programming allows us to build the¬†PP¬†in my pajamas¬†just once. The first time we build it we save it in a table, then we look it up when we need to use it as a subconstituent of either the object¬†NP¬†or the higher¬†VP. This table is known as a¬†well-formed substring table, or WFST for short. (The term "substring" refers to a contiguous sequence of words within a sentence.) We will show how to construct the WFST bottom-up so as to systematically record what syntactic constituents have been found.

Let's set our input to be the sentence in¬†(2). The numerically specified spans of the WFST are reminiscent of Python's slice notation (3.2). Another way to think about the data structure is shown in¬†4.3, a data structure known as a¬†chart.

Ôøº

Figure 4.3: The Chart Data Structure: words are the edge labels of a linear graph structure.

In a WFST, we record the position of the words by filling in cells in a triangular matrix: the vertical axis will denote the start position of a substring, while the horizontal axis will denote the end position (thus¬†shot¬†will appear in the cell with coordinates (1, 2)). To simplify this presentation, we will assume each word has a unique lexical category, and we will store this (not the word) in the matrix. So cell (1, 2) will contain the entry¬†V. More generally, if our input string is¬†a0a1¬†...¬†an, and our grammar contains a production of the form¬†A¬†‚Üí¬†ai, then we add¬†A¬†to the cell (i,¬†`i`+1).

System Message: WARNING/2 (ch08.rst2, line 900);¬†backlink

Inline interpreted text or phrase reference start-string without end-string.

So, for every word in¬†text, we can look up in our grammar what category it belongs to.

¬†>>> text = ['I', 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas'] >>> groucho_grammar.productions(rhs=text[1]) [V -> 'shot']

For our WFST, we create an¬†(n-1)¬†√ó¬†(n-1)¬†matrix as a list of lists in Python, and initialize it with the lexical categories of each token, in the¬†init_wfst()¬†function in¬†4.4. We also define a utility function¬†display()¬†to pretty-print the WFST for us. As expected, there is a¬†V¬†in cell (1, 2).

¬†def init_wfst(tokens, grammar): numtokens = len(tokens) wfst = [[None for i in range(numtokens+1)] for j in range(numtokens+1)] for i in range(numtokens): productions = grammar.productions(rhs=tokens[i]) wfst[i][i+1] = productions[0].lhs() return wfst def complete_wfst(wfst, tokens, grammar, trace=False): index = dict((p.rhs(), p.lhs()) for p in grammar.productions()) numtokens = len(tokens) for span in range(2, numtokens+1): for start in range(numtokens+1-span): end = start + span for mid in range(start+1, end): nt1, nt2 = wfst[start][mid], wfst[mid][end] if nt1 and nt2 and (nt1,nt2) in index: wfst[start][end] = index[(nt1,nt2)] if trace: print("[%s] %3s [%s] %3s [%s] ==> [%s] %3s [%s]" % \ (start, nt1, mid, nt2, end, start, index[(nt1,nt2)], end)) return wfst def display(wfst, tokens): print('\nWFST ' + ' '.join(("%-4d" % i) for i in range(1, len(wfst)))) for i in range(len(wfst)-1): print("%d " % i, end=" ") for j in range(1, len(wfst)): print("%-4s" % (wfst[i][j] or '.'), end=" ") print() >>> tokens = "I shot an elephant in my pajamas".split() >>> wfst0 = init_wfst(tokens, groucho_grammar) >>> display(wfst0, tokens) WFST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 NP . . . . . . 1 .

Example 4.4 (code_wfst.py):¬†Figure 4.4: Acceptor Using Well-Formed Substring Table

Returning to our tabular representation, given that we have¬†Det¬†in cell (2, 3) for the word¬†an, and¬†N¬†in cell (3, 4) for the word¬†elephant, what should we put into cell (2, 4) for¬†an elephant? We need to find a production of the form¬†A¬†‚Üí¬†Det N. Consulting the grammar, we know that we can enter¬†NP¬†in cell (2, 4).

More generally, we can enter¬†A¬†in¬†(i, j)¬†if there is a production¬†A¬†‚Üí¬†B¬†C, and we find nonterminal¬†B¬†in¬†(i, k)¬†and¬†C¬†in¬†(k, j). The program in¬†4.4¬†uses this rule to complete the WFST. By setting¬†trace¬†to¬†True¬†when calling the function¬†complete_wfst(), we see tracing output that shows the WFST being constructed:

¬†>>> wfst1 = complete_wfst(wfst0, tokens, groucho_grammar, trace=True) [2] Det [3] N [4] ==> [2] NP [4] [5] Det [6] N [7] ==> [5] NP [7] [1] V [2] NP [4] ==> [1] VP [4] [4] P [5] NP [7] ==> [4] PP [7] [0] NP [1] VP [4] ==> [0] S [4] [1] VP [4] PP [7] ==> [1] VP [7] [0] NP [1] VP [7] ==> [0] S [7]

For example, this says that since we found¬†Det¬†at¬†wfst[2][3]¬†and¬†N¬†at¬†wfst[3][4], we can add¬†NP¬†to¬†wfst[2][4].

Note

To help us easily retrieve productions by their right hand sides, we create an index for the grammar. This is an example of a space-time trade-off: we do a reverse lookup on the grammar, instead of having to check through the entire list of productions each time we want to look up via the right hand side.

Ôøº

Figure 4.5: The Chart Data Structure: non-terminals are represented as extra edges in the chart.

We conclude that there is a parse for the whole input string once we have constructed an¬†S¬†node in cell (0, 7), showing that we have found a sentence that covers the whole input. The final state of the WFST is depicted in¬†4.5.

Notice that we have not used any built-in parsing functions here. We've implemented a complete, primitive chart parser from the ground up!

WFST's have several shortcomings. First, as you can see, the WFST is not itself a parse tree, so the technique is strictly speaking¬†recognizing¬†that a sentence is admitted by a grammar, rather than parsing it. Second, it requires every non-lexical grammar production to be¬†binary. Although it is possible to convert an arbitrary CFG into this form, we would prefer to use an approach without such a requirement. Third, as a bottom-up approach it is potentially wasteful, being able to propose constituents in locations that would not be licensed by the grammar.

Finally, the WFST did not represent the structural ambiguity in the sentence (i.e. the two verb phrase readings). The¬†VP¬†in cell (1, 7) was actually entered twice, once for a¬†V NP¬†reading, and once for a¬†VP PP¬†reading. These are different hypotheses, and the second overwrote the first (as it happens this didn't matter since the left hand side was the same.) Chart parsers use a slighly richer data structure and some interesting algorithms to solve these problems (see the Further Reading section at the end of this chapter for details).

5¬†¬†¬†Dependencies and Dependency Grammar

Phrase structure grammar is concerned with how words and sequences of words¬†combine¬†to form constituents. A distinct and complementary approach, dependency grammar, focusses instead on how words¬†relate¬†to other words. Dependency is a binary asymmetric relation that holds between a¬†head¬†and its¬†dependents. The head of a sentence is usually taken to be the tensed verb, and every other word is either dependent on the sentence head, or connects to it through a path of dependencies.

A dependency representation is a labeled directed graph, where the nodes are the lexical items and the labeled arcs represent dependency relations from heads to dependents.¬†5.1¬†illustrates a dependency graph, where arrows point from heads to their dependents.

Ôøº

Figure 5.1: Dependency Structure: arrows point from heads to their dependents; labels indicate the grammatical function of the dependent as subject, object or modifier.

The arcs in¬†5.1¬†are labeled with the grammatical function that holds between a dependent and its head. For example,¬†I¬†is the¬†SBJ¬†(subject) of¬†shot¬†(which is the head of the whole sentence), and¬†in¬†is an¬†NMOD¬†(noun modifier of¬†elephant). In contrast to phrase structure grammar, therefore, dependency grammars can be used to directly express grammatical functions as a type of dependency.

Here's one way of encoding a dependency grammar in NLTK ‚Äî note that it only captures bare dependency information without specifying the type of dependency:

¬†>>> groucho_dep_grammar = nltk.DependencyGrammar.fromstring(""" ... 'shot' -> 'I' | 'elephant' | 'in' ... 'elephant' -> 'an' | 'in' ... 'in' -> 'pajamas' ... 'pajamas' -> 'my' ... """) >>> print(groucho_dep_grammar) Dependency grammar with 7 productions 'shot' -> 'I' 'shot' -> 'elephant' 'shot' -> 'in' 'elephant' -> 'an' 'elephant' -> 'in' 'in' -> 'pajamas' 'pajamas' -> 'my'

A dependency graph is¬†projective¬†if, when all the words are written in linear order, the edges can be drawn above the words without crossing. This is equivalent to saying that a word and all its descendents (dependents and dependents of its dependents, etc.) form a contiguous sequence of words within the sentence.¬†5.1¬†is projective, and we can parse many sentences in English using a projective dependency parser. The next example shows how¬†groucho_dep_grammar¬†provides an alternative approach to capturing the attachment ambiguity that we examined earlier with phrase structure grammar.

¬†>>> pdp = nltk.ProjectiveDependencyParser(groucho_dep_grammar) >>> sent = 'I shot an elephant in my pajamas'.split() >>> trees = pdp.parse(sent) >>> for tree in trees: ... print(tree) (shot I (elephant an (in (pajamas my)))) (shot I (elephant an) (in (pajamas my)))

These bracketed dependency structures can also be displayed as trees, where dependents are shown as children of their heads.

(14)ÔøºÔøº

In languages with more flexible word order than English, non-projective dependencies are more frequent.

Various criteria have been proposed for deciding what is the head¬†H¬†and what is the dependent¬†D¬†in a construction¬†C. Some of the most important are the following:

H¬†determines the distribution class of¬†C; or alternatively, the external syntactic properties of¬†C¬†are due to¬†H.

H¬†determines the semantic type of¬†C.

H¬†is obligatory while¬†D¬†may be optional.

H¬†selects¬†D¬†and determines whether it is obligatory or optional.

The morphological form of¬†D¬†is determined by¬†H¬†(e.g. agreement or case government).

When we say in a phrase structure grammar that the immediate constituents of a¬†PP¬†are¬†P¬†and¬†NP, we are implicitly appealing to the head / dependent distinction. A prepositional phrase is a phrase whose head is a preposition; moreover, the¬†NP¬†is a dependent of¬†P. The same distinction carries over to the other types of phrase that we have discussed. The key point to note here is that although phrase structure grammars seem very different from dependency grammars, they implicitly embody a recognition of dependency relations. While CFGs are not intended to directly capture dependencies, more recent linguistic frameworks have increasingly adopted formalisms which combine aspects of both approaches.

5.1¬†¬†¬†Valency and the Lexicon

Let us take a closer look at verbs and their dependents. The grammar in¬†3.3¬†correctly generates examples like¬†(15d).

(15)

a.The squirrel was frightened.

b.Chatterer saw the bear.

c.Chatterer thought Buster was angry.

d.Joe put the fish on the log.

These possibilities correspond to the following productions:

Table 5.1:

VP productions and their lexical heads

VP -> V AdjwasVP -> V NPsawVP -> V SthoughtVP -> V NP PPput

That is,¬†was¬†can occur with a following¬†Adj,¬†saw¬†can occur with a following¬†NP,¬†thought¬†can occur with a following¬†S¬†and¬†put¬†can occur with a following¬†NP¬†and¬†PP. The dependents¬†Adj,¬†NP,¬†PP¬†and¬†S¬†are often called¬†complements¬†of the respective verbs and there are strong constraints on what verbs can occur with what complements. By contrast with¬†(15d), the word sequences in¬†(16d)¬†are ill-formed:

(16)

a.*The squirrel was Buster was angry.

b.*Chatterer saw frightened.

c.*Chatterer thought the bear.

d.*Joe put on the log.

Note

With a little imagination, it is possible to invent contexts in which unusual combinations of verbs and complements are interpretable. However, we assume that the above examples are to be interpreted in neutral contexts.

In the tradition of dependency grammar, the verbs in¬†5.1¬†are said to have different¬†valencies. Valency restrictions are not just applicable to verbs, but also to the other classes of heads.

Within frameworks based on phrase structure grammar, various techniques have been proposed for excluding the ungrammatical examples in¬†(16d). In a CFG, we need some way of constraining grammar productions which expand¬†VP¬†so that verbs¬†only¬†co-occur with their correct complements. We can do this by dividing the class of verbs into "subcategories", each of which is associated with a different set of complements. For example,¬†transitive verbs¬†such as¬†chased¬†and¬†saw¬†require a following¬†NP¬†object complement; that is, they are¬†subcategorized¬†for¬†NP¬†direct objects. If we introduce a new category label for transitive verbs, namely¬†TV¬†(for Transitive Verb), then we can use it in the following productions:

VP -> TV NP TV -> 'chased' | 'saw' 

Now¬†*Joe thought the bear¬†is excluded since we haven't listed¬†thought¬†as a¬†TV, but¬†Chatterer saw the bear¬†is still allowed.¬†5.2¬†provides more examples of labels for verb subcategories.

Table 5.2:

Verb Subcategories

SymbolMeaningExampleIVintransitive verbbarkedTVtransitive verbsaw a manDatVdative verbgave a dog to a manSVsentential verbsaid that a dog barked

Valency is a property of lexical items, and we will discuss it further in¬†9..

Complements are often contrasted with modifiers (or adjuncts), although both are kinds of dependent. Prepositional phrases, adjectives and adverbs typically function as modifiers. Unlike complements, modifiers are optional, can often be iterated, and are not selected for by heads in the same way as complements. For example, the adverb¬†really¬†can be added as a modifer to all the sentence in¬†(17d):

(17)

a.The squirrel really was frightened.

b.Chatterer really saw the bear.

c.Chatterer really thought Buster was angry.

d.Joe really put the fish on the log.

The structural ambiguity of¬†PP¬†attachment, which we have illustrated in both phrase structure and dependency grammars, corresponds semantically to an ambiguity in the scope of the modifier.

5.2¬†¬†¬†Scaling Up

So far, we have only considered "toy grammars," small grammars that illustrate the key aspects of parsing. But there is an obvious question as to whether the approach can be scaled up to cover large corpora of natural languages. How hard would it be to construct such a set of productions by hand? In general, the answer is:¬†very hard. Even if we allow ourselves to use various formal devices that give much more succinct representations of grammar productions, it is still extremely difficult to keep control of the complex interactions between the many productions required to cover the major constructions of a language. In other words, it is hard to modularize grammars so that one portion can be developed independently of the other parts. This in turn means that it is difficult to distribute the task of grammar writing across a team of linguists. Another difficulty is that as the grammar expands to cover a wider and wider range of constructions, there is a corresponding increase in the number of analyses which are admitted for any one sentence. In other words, ambiguity increases with coverage.

Despite these problems, some large collaborative projects have achieved interesting and impressive results in developing rule-based grammars for several languages. Examples are the Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) Pargram project, the Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) LinGO Matrix framework, and the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar XTAG Project.

6¬†¬†¬†Grammar Development

Parsing builds trees over sentences, according to a phrase structure grammar. Now, all the examples we gave above only involved toy grammars containing a handful of productions. What happens if we try to scale up this approach to deal with realistic corpora of language? In this section we will see how to access treebanks, and look at the challenge of developing broad-coverage grammars.

6.1¬†¬†¬†Treebanks and Grammars

The¬†corpus¬†module defines the¬†treebank¬†corpus reader, which contains a 10% sample of the Penn Treebank corpus.

¬†>>> from nltk.corpus import treebank >>> t = treebank.parsed_sents('wsj_0001.mrg')[0] >>> print(t) (S (NP-SBJ (NP (NNP Pierre) (NNP Vinken)) (, ,) (ADJP (NP (CD 61) (NNS years)) (JJ old)) (, ,)) (VP (MD will) (VP (VB join) (NP (DT the) (NN board)) (PP-CLR (IN as) (NP (DT a) (JJ nonexecutive) (NN director))) (NP-TMP (NNP Nov.) (CD 29)))) (. .))

We can use this data to help develop a grammar. For example, the program in¬†6.1¬†uses a simple filter to find verbs that take sentential complements. Assuming we already have a production of the form¬†VP -> Vs S, this information enables us to identify particular verbs that would be included in the expansion of¬†Vs.

¬†def filter(tree): child_nodes = [child.label() for child in tree if isinstance(child, nltk.Tree)] return (tree.label() == 'VP') and ('S' in child_nodes)¬†>>> from nltk.corpus import treebank >>> [subtree for tree in treebank.parsed_sents() ... for subtree in tree.subtrees(filter)] [Tree('VP', [Tree('VBN', ['named']), Tree('S', [Tree('NP-SBJ', ...]), ...]), ...]

Example 6.1 (code_sentential_complement.py):¬†Figure 6.1: Searching a Treebank to find Sentential Complements

The Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus,¬†nltk.corpus.ppattach¬†is another source of information about the valency of particular verbs. Here we illustrate a technique for mining this corpus. It finds pairs of prepositional phrases where the preposition and noun are fixed, but where the choice of verb determines whether the prepositional phrase is attached to the¬†VP¬†or to the¬†NP.

¬†>>> from collections import defaultdict >>> entries = nltk.corpus.ppattach.attachments('training') >>> table = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(set)) >>> for entry in entries: ... key = entry.noun1 + '-' + entry.prep + '-' + entry.noun2 ... table[key][entry.attachment].add(entry.verb) ... >>> for key in sorted(table): ... if len(table[key]) > 1: ... print(key, 'N:', sorted(table[key]['N']), 'V:', sorted(table[key]['V']))

Amongst the output lines of this program we find¬†offer-from-group N: ['rejected'] V: ['received'], which indicates that¬†received¬†expects a separate¬†PP¬†complement attached to the¬†VP, while¬†rejected¬†does not. As before, we can use this information to help construct the grammar.

The NLTK corpus collection includes data from the PE08 Cross-Framework and Cross Domain Parser Evaluation Shared Task. A collection of larger grammars has been prepared for the purpose of comparing different parsers, which can be obtained by downloading the¬†large_grammars¬†package (e.g.¬†python -m nltk.downloader large_grammars).

The NLTK corpus collection also includes a sample from the¬†Sinica Treebank Corpus, consisting of 10,000 parsed sentences drawn from the¬†Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese. Let's load and display one of the trees in this corpus.

¬†>>> nltk.corpus.sinica_treebank.parsed_sents()[3450].draw() 

Ôøº

6.2¬†¬†¬†Pernicious Ambiguity

Unfortunately, as the coverage of the grammar increases and the length of the input sentences grows, the number of parse trees grows rapidly. In fact, it grows at an astronomical rate.

Let's explore this issue with the help of a simple example. The word¬†fish¬†is both a noun and a verb. We can make up the sentence¬†fish fish fish, meaning¬†fish like to fish for other fish. (Try this with¬†police¬†if you prefer something more sensible.) Here is a toy grammar for the "fish" sentences.

¬†>>> grammar = nltk.CFG.fromstring(""" ... S -> NP V NP ... NP -> NP Sbar ... Sbar -> NP V ... NP -> 'fish' ... V -> 'fish' ... """)

Now we can try parsing a longer sentence,¬†fish fish fish fish fish, which amongst other things, means 'fish that other fish fish are in the habit of fishing fish themselves'. We use the NLTK chart parser, which was mentioned earlier in this chapter. This sentence has two readings.

¬†>>> tokens = ["fish"] * 5 >>> cp = nltk.ChartParser(grammar) >>> for tree in cp.parse(tokens): ... print(tree) (S (NP fish) (V fish) (NP (NP fish) (Sbar (NP fish) (V fish)))) (S (NP (NP fish) (Sbar (NP fish) (V fish))) (V fish) (NP fish))

As the length of this sentence goes up (3, 5, 7, ...) we get the following numbers of parse trees: 1; 2; 5; 14; 42; 132; 429; 1,430; 4,862; 16,796; 58,786; 208,012; ... (These are the¬†Catalan numbers, which we saw in an exercise in¬†4). The last of these is for a sentence of length 23, the average length of sentences in the WSJ section of Penn Treebank. For a sentence of length 50 there would be over 1012¬†parses, and this is only half the length of the Piglet sentence (1), which young children process effortlessly. No practical NLP system could construct millions of trees for a sentence and choose the appropriate one in the context. It's clear that humans don't do this either!

Note that the problem is not with our choice of example.¬†(Church & Patil, 1982)¬†point out that the syntactic ambiguity of¬†PP¬†attachment in sentences like¬†(18)¬†also grows in proportion to the Catalan numbers.

(18)Put the block in the box on the table.

So much for structural ambiguity; what about lexical ambiguity? As soon as we try to construct a broad-coverage grammar, we are forced to make lexical entries highly ambiguous for their part of speech. In a toy grammar,¬†a¬†is only a determiner,¬†dog¬†is only a noun, and¬†runs¬†is only a verb. However, in a broad-coverage grammar,¬†a¬†is also a noun (e.g.¬†part a),¬†dog¬†is also a verb (meaning to follow closely), and¬†runs¬†is also a noun (e.g.¬†ski runs). In fact, all words can be referred to by name: e.g.¬†the verb 'ate' is spelled with three letters; in speech we do not need to supply quotation marks. Furthermore, it is possible to¬†verb¬†most nouns. Thus a parser for a broad-coverage grammar will be overwhelmed with ambiguity. Even complete gibberish will often have a reading, e.g.¬†the a are of I. As¬†(Klavans & Resnik, 1996)¬†has pointed out, this is not word salad but a grammatical noun phrase, in which¬†are¬†is a noun meaning a hundredth of a hectare (or 100 sq m), and¬†a¬†and¬†I¬†are nouns designating coordinates, as shown in¬†6.2.

Ôøº

Figure 6.2: "The a are of I": a schematic drawing of 27 paddocks, each being one "are" in size, and each identified using coordinates; the top left cell is the¬†a¬†"are" of column¬†I¬†(after Abney).

Even though this phrase is unlikely, it is still grammatical and a broad-coverage parser should be able to construct a parse tree for it. Similarly, sentences that seem to be unambiguous, such as¬†John saw Mary, turn out to have other readings we would not have anticipated (as Abney explains). This ambiguity is unavoidable, and leads to horrendous inefficiency in parsing seemingly innocuous sentences. The solution to these problems is provided by¬†probabilistic parsing, which allows us to¬†rank¬†the parses of an ambiguous sentence on the basis of evidence from corpora.

6.3¬†¬†¬†Weighted Grammar

As we have just seen, dealing with ambiguity is a key challenge in developing broad coverage parsers. Chart parsers improve the efficiency of computing multiple parses of the same sentences, but they are still overwhelmed by the sheer number of possible parses. Weighted grammars and probabilistic parsing algorithms have provided an effective solution to these problems.

Before looking at these, we need to understand why the notion of grammaticality could be¬†gradient. Considering the verb¬†give. This verb requires both a direct object (the thing being given) and an indirect object (the recipient). These complements can be given in either order, as illustrated in¬†(19). In the "prepositional dative" form in¬†(19a), the direct object appears first, followed by a prepositional phrase containing the indirect object.

(19)

a.Kim gave a bone to the dog

b.Kim gave the dog a bone

In the "double object" form in¬†(19b), the indirect object appears first, followed by the direct object. In the above case, either order is acceptable. However, if the indirect object is a pronoun, there is a strong preference for the double object construction:

(20)

a.Kim gives the heebie-jeebies to me (*prepositional dative)

b.Kim gives me the heebie-jeebies (double object)

Using the Penn Treebank sample, we can examine all instances of prepositional dative and double object constructions involving¬†give, as shown in¬†6.3.

¬†def give(t): return t.label() == 'VP' and len(t) > 2 and t[1].label() == 'NP'\ and (t[2].label() == 'PP-DTV' or t[2].label() == 'NP')\ and ('give' in t[0].leaves() or 'gave' in t[0].leaves()) def sent(t): return ' '.join(token for token in t.leaves() if token[0] not in '*-0') def print_node(t, width): output = "%s %s: %s / %s: %s" %\ (sent(t[0]), t[1].label(), sent(t[1]), t[2].label(), sent(t[2])) if len(output) > width: output = output[:width] + "..." print(output)¬†>>> for tree in nltk.corpus.treebank.parsed_sents(): ... for t in tree.subtrees(give): ... print_node(t, 72) gave NP: the chefs / NP: a standing ovation give NP: advertisers / NP: discounts for maintaining or increasing ad sp... give NP: it / PP-DTV: to the politicians gave NP: them / NP: similar help give NP: them / NP: give NP: only French history questions / PP-DTV: to students in a Europe... give NP: federal judges / NP: a raise give NP: consumers / NP: the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis gave NP: Mitsui / NP: access to a high-tech medical product give NP: Mitsubishi / NP: a window on the U.S. glass industry give NP: much thought / PP-DTV: to the rates she was receiving , nor to ... give NP: your Foster Savings Institution / NP: the gift of hope and free... give NP: market operators / NP: the authority to suspend trading in futu... gave NP: quick approval / PP-DTV: to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appr... give NP: the Transportation Department / NP: up to 50 days to review any... give NP: the president / NP: such power give NP: me / NP: the heebie-jeebies give NP: holders / NP: the right , but not the obligation , to buy a cal... gave NP: Mr. Thomas / NP: only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than ``... give NP: the president / NP: line-item veto power

Example 6.3 (code_give.py):¬†Figure 6.3: Usage of Give and Gave in the Penn Treebank sample

We can observe a strong tendency for the shortest complement to appear first. However, this does not account for a form like¬†give NP: federal judges / NP: a raise, where animacy may play a role. In fact there turn out to be a large number of contributing factors, as surveyed by¬†(Bresnan & Hay, 2006). Such preferences can be represented in a weighted grammar.

A¬†probabilistic context free grammar¬†(or¬†PCFG) is a context free grammar that associates a probability with each of its productions. It generates the same set of parses for a text that the corresponding context free grammar does, and assigns a probability to each parse. The probability of a parse generated by a PCFG is simply the product of the probabilities of the productions used to generate it.

The simplest way to define a PCFG is to load it from a specially formatted string consisting of a sequence of weighted productions, where weights appear in brackets, as shown in¬†6.4.

¬†grammar = nltk.PCFG.fromstring(""" S -> NP VP [1.0] VP -> TV NP [0.4] VP -> IV [0.3] VP -> DatV NP NP [0.3] TV -> 'saw' [1.0] IV -> 'ate' [1.0] DatV -> 'gave' [1.0] NP -> 'telescopes' [0.8] NP -> 'Jack' [0.2] """)¬†>>> print(grammar) Grammar with 9 productions (start state = S) S -> NP VP [1.0] VP -> TV NP [0.4] VP -> IV [0.3] VP -> DatV NP NP [0.3] TV -> 'saw' [1.0] IV -> 'ate' [1.0] DatV -> 'gave' [1.0] NP -> 'telescopes' [0.8] NP -> 'Jack' [0.2]

Example 6.4 (code_pcfg1.py):¬†Figure 6.4: Defining a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG)

It is sometimes convenient to combine multiple productions into a single line, e.g.¬†VP -> TV NP [0.4] | IV [0.3] | DatV NP NP [0.3]. In order to ensure that the trees generated by the grammar form a probability distribution, PCFG grammars impose the constraint that all productions with a given left-hand side must have probabilities that sum to one. The grammar in¬†6.4¬†obeys this constraint: for¬†S, there is only one production, with a probability of 1.0; for¬†VP, 0.4+0.3+0.3=1.0; and for¬†NP, 0.8+0.2=1.0. The parse tree returned by¬†parse()¬†includes probabilities:

¬†>>> viterbi_parser = nltk.ViterbiParser(grammar) >>> for tree in viterbi_parser.parse(['Jack', 'saw', 'telescopes']): ... print(tree) (S (NP Jack) (VP (TV saw) (NP telescopes))) (p=0.064)

Now that parse trees are assigned probabilities, it no longer matters that there may be a huge number of possible parses for a given sentence. A parser will be responsible for finding the most likely parses.

7¬†¬†¬†Summary

Sentences have internal organization that can be represented using a tree. Notable features of constituent structure are: recursion, heads, complements and modifiers.

A grammar is a compact characterization of a potentially infinite set of sentences; we say that a tree is well-formed according to a grammar, or that a grammar licenses a tree.

A grammar is a formal model for describing whether a given phrase can be assigned a particular constituent or dependency structure.

Given a set of syntactic categories, a context-free grammar uses a set of productions to say how a phrase of some category¬†A¬†can be analyzed into a sequence of smaller parts Œ±1¬†... Œ±n.

A dependency grammar uses productions to specify what the dependents are of a given lexical head.

Syntactic ambiguity arises when one sentence has more than one syntactic analysis (e.g. prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity).

A parser is a procedure for finding one or more trees corresponding to a grammatically well-formed sentence.

A simple top-down parser is the recursive descent parser, which recursively expands the start symbol (usually¬†S) with the help of the grammar productions, and tries to match the input sentence. This parser cannot handle left-recursive productions (e.g., productions such as¬†NP -> NP PP). It is inefficient in the way it blindly expands categories without checking whether they are compatible with the input string, and in repeatedly expanding the same non-terminals and discarding the results.

A simple bottom-up parser is the shift-reduce parser, which shifts input onto a stack and tries to match the items at the top of the stack with the right hand side of grammar productions. This parser is not guaranteed to find a valid parse for the input even if one exists, and builds substructure without checking whether it is globally consistent with the grammar.

There are many introductory books on syntax.¬†(O'Grady et al, 2004)¬†is a general introduction to linguistics, while¬†(Radford, 1988)¬†provides a gentle introduction to transformational grammar, and can be recommended for its coverage of transformational approaches to unbounded dependency constructions. The most widely used term in linguistics for formal grammar is¬†generative grammar, though it has nothing to do with generation¬†(Chomsky, 1965). The framework of X-bar Syntax is due to¬†(Jacobs & Rosenbaum, 1970), and is explored at greater length in¬†(Jackendoff, 1977)¬†(The primes we use replace Chomsky's typographically more demanding horizontal bars.)

(Burton-Roberts, 1997)¬†is a practically oriented textbook on how to analyze constituency in English, with extensive exemplification and exercises.¬†(Huddleston & Pullum, 2002)¬†provides an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of syntactic phenomena in English.

Chapter 12 of¬†(Jurafsky & Martin, 2008)¬†covers formal grammars of English; Sections 13.1-3 cover simple parsing algorithms and techniques for dealing with ambiguity; Chapter 14 covers statistical parsing; Chapter 16 covers the Chomsky hierarchy and the formal complexity of natural language.¬†(Levin, 1993)¬†has categorized English verbs into fine-grained classes, according to their syntactic properties.

There are several ongoing efforts to build large-scale rule-based grammars, e.g. the LFG Pargram project¬†http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/nltt/pargram/, the HPSG LinGO Matrix framework¬†http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/¬†and the XTAG Project¬†http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/.

9¬†¬†¬†Exercises

‚òº Can you come up with grammatical sentences that have probably never been uttered before? (Take turns with a partner.) What does this tell you about human language?

‚òº Recall Strunk and White's prohibition against sentence-initial¬†however¬†used to mean "although". Do a web search for¬†however¬†used at the start of the sentence. How widely used is this construction?

‚òº Consider the sentence¬†Kim arrived or Dana left and everyone cheered. Write down the parenthesized forms to show the relative scope of¬†and¬†and¬†or. Generate tree structures corresponding to both of these interpretations.

‚òº The¬†Tree¬†class implements a variety of other useful methods. See the¬†Tree¬†help documentation for more details, i.e. import the Tree class and then type¬†help(Tree).

‚òº In this exercise you will manually construct some parse trees.

Write code to produce two trees, one for each reading of the phrase¬†old men and women

Encode any of the trees presented in this chapter as a labeled bracketing and use¬†nltk.Tree()¬†to check that it is well-formed. Now use¬†draw()¬†to display the tree.

As in (a) above, draw a tree for¬†The woman saw a man last Thursday.

‚òº Write a recursive function to traverse a tree and return the depth of the tree, such that a tree with a single node would have depth zero. (Hint: the depth of a subtree is the maximum depth of its children, plus one.)

‚òº Analyze the A.A. Milne sentence about Piglet, by underlining all of the sentences it contains then replacing these with¬†S¬†(e.g. the first sentence becomes¬†S¬†when:lx`¬†S). Draw a tree structure for this "compressed" sentence. What are the main syntactic constructions used for building such a long sentence?

‚òº In the recursive descent parser demo, experiment with changing the sentence to be parsed by selecting¬†Edit Text¬†in the¬†Edit¬†menu.

‚òº Can the grammar in¬†grammar1¬†be used to describe sentences that are more than 20 words in length?

‚òº Use the graphical chart-parser interface to experiment with different rule invocation strategies. Come up with your own strategy that you can execute manually using the graphical interface. Describe the steps, and report any efficiency improvements it has (e.g. in terms of the size of the resulting chart). Do these improvements depend on the structure of the grammar? What do you think of the prospects for significant performance boosts from cleverer rule invocation strategies?

‚òº With pen and paper, manually trace the execution of a recursive descent parser and a shift-reduce parser, for a CFG you have already seen, or one of your own devising.

‚òº We have seen that a chart parser adds but never removes edges from a chart. Why?

‚òº Consider the sequence of words:¬†Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo. This is a grammatically correct sentence, as explained at¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo.¬†Consider the tree diagram presented on this Wikipedia page, and write down a suitable grammar. Normalize case to lowercase, to simulate the problem that a listener has when hearing this sentence. Can you find other parses for this sentence? How does the number of parse trees grow as the sentence gets longer? (More examples of these sentences can be found at¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homophonous_phrases).

‚óë You can modify the grammar in the recursive descent parser demo by selecting¬†Edit Grammar¬†in the¬†Edit¬†menu. Change the second expansion production, namely¬†NP -> Det N PP, to¬†NP -> NP PP. Using the¬†Step¬†button, try to build a parse tree. What happens?

‚óë Extend the grammar in¬†grammar2¬†with productions that expand prepositions as intransitive, transitive and requiring a¬†PP¬†complement. Based on these productions, use the method of the preceding exercise to draw a tree for the sentence¬†Lee ran away home.

‚óë Pick some common verbs and complete the following tasks:

Write a program to find those verbs in the Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus¬†nltk.corpus.ppattach. Find any cases where the same verb exhibits two different attachments, but where the first noun, or second noun, or preposition, stay unchanged (as we saw in our discussion of syntactic ambiguity in¬†2).

Devise CFG grammar productions to cover some of these cases.

‚óë Write a program to compare the efficiency of a top-down chart parser compared with a recursive descent parser (4). Use the same grammar and input sentences for both. Compare their performance using the¬†timeit¬†module (see¬†4.7¬†for an example of how to do this).

‚óë Compare the performance of the top-down, bottom-up, and left-corner parsers using the same grammar and three grammatical test sentences. Use¬†timeit¬†to log the amount of time each parser takes on the same sentence. Write a function that runs all three parsers on all three sentences, and prints a 3-by-3 grid of times, as well as row and column totals. Discuss your findings.

‚óë Read up on "garden path" sentences. How might the computational work of a parser relate to the difficulty humans have with processing these sentences?¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence

‚óë To compare multiple trees in a single window, we can use the¬†draw_trees()¬†method. Define some trees and try it out:

¬†>>> from nltk.draw.tree import draw_trees >>> draw_trees(tree1, tree2, tree3) 

‚óë Using tree positions, list the subjects of the first 100 sentences in the Penn treebank; to make the results easier to view, limit the extracted subjects to subtrees whose height is 2.

‚óë Inspect the Prepositional Phrase Attachment Corpus and try to suggest some factors that influence¬†PP¬†attachment.

‚óë In this section we claimed that there are linguistic regularities that cannot be described simply in terms of n-grams. Consider the following sentence, particularly the position of the phrase¬†in his turn. Does this illustrate a problem for an approach based on n-grams?

What was more, the in his turn somewhat youngish Nikolay Parfenovich also turned out to be the only person in the entire world to acquire a sincere liking to our "discriminated-against" public procurator.¬†(Dostoevsky: The Brothers Karamazov)

‚óë Write a recursive function that produces a nested bracketing for a tree, leaving out the leaf nodes, and displaying the non-terminal labels after their subtrees. So the above example about Pierre Vinken would produce:¬†[[[NNP NNP]NP , [ADJP [CD NNS]NP JJ]ADJP ,]NP-SBJ MD [VB [DT NN]NP [IN [DT JJ NN]NP]PP-CLR [NNP CD]NP-TMP]VP .]S¬†Consecutive categories should be separated by space.

‚óë Download several electronic books from Project Gutenberg. Write a program to scan these texts for any extremely long sentences. What is the longest sentence you can find? What syntactic construction(s) are responsible for such long sentences?

‚óë Modify the functions¬†init_wfst()¬†and¬†complete_wfst()¬†so that the contents of each cell in the WFST is a set of non-terminal symbols rather than a single non-terminal.

‚óë Consider the algorithm in¬†4.4. Can you explain why parsing context-free grammar is proportional to¬†n3, where¬†n¬†is the length of the input sentence.

‚óë Process each tree of the Treebank corpus sample¬†nltk.corpus.treebank¬†and extract the productions with the help of¬†Tree.productions(). Discard the productions that occur only once. Productions with the same left hand side, and similar right hand sides can be collapsed, resulting in an equivalent but more compact set of rules. Write code to output a compact grammar.

‚òÖ One common way of defining the subject of a sentence¬†S¬†in English is as¬†the noun phrase that is the child of¬†S¬†and the sibling of¬†VP. Write a function that takes the tree for a sentence and returns the subtree corresponding to the subject of the sentence. What should it do if the root node of the tree passed to this function is not¬†S, or it lacks a subject?

‚òÖ Write a function that takes a grammar (such as the one defined in¬†3.1) and returns a random sentence generated by the grammar. (Use¬†grammar.start()¬†to find the start symbol of the grammar;¬†grammar.productions(lhs)¬†to get the list of productions from the grammar that have the specified left-hand side; and¬†production.rhs()¬†to get the right-hand side of a production.)

‚òÖ Implement a version of the shift-reduce parser using backtracking, so that it finds all possible parses for a sentence, what might be called a "recursive ascent parser." Consult the Wikipedia entry for backtracking at¬†http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking

‚òÖ As we saw in¬†7., it is possible to collapse chunks down to their chunk label. When we do this for sentences involving the word¬†gave, we find patterns such as the following:

gave NP gave up NP in NP gave NP up gave NP NP gave NP to NP 

Use this method to study the complementation patterns of a verb of interest, and write suitable grammar productions. (This task is sometimes called¬†lexical acquisition.)

Identify some English verbs that are near-synonyms, such as the¬†dumped/filled/loaded¬†example from earlier in this chapter. Use the chunking method to study the complementation patterns of these verbs. Create a grammar to cover these cases. Can the verbs be freely substituted for each other, or are their constraints? Discuss your findings.

‚òÖ Develop a left-corner parser based on the recursive descent parser, and inheriting from¬†ParseI.

‚òÖ Extend NLTK's shift-reduce parser to incorporate backtracking, so that it is guaranteed to find all parses that exist (i.e. it is¬†complete).

‚òÖ Modify the functions¬†init_wfst()¬†and¬†complete_wfst()¬†so that when a non-terminal symbol is added to a cell in the WFST, it includes a record of the cells from which it was derived. Implement a function that will convert a WFST in this form to a parse tree.

The information in the Reduced Costs column indicates how much the objective func- tion coefficient of each decision variable wou!d have to improve before it would be pos- sible for that variable to assume a positive value in the optimal solution. If a decision variable is already positive in the optimal solution, its reduced cost is zero. For the Par. Inc., problem, the optimal solution is S=540 and D = 252. Since both variables already have positive values, their corresponding reduced costs are zero. In Chapter 3 we will in- lerpret the reduced cost for a decision variable that does not have a positive value in the optimal solution.

Immediately following the optimal S and D values and the reduced cost information, the computer output provides information about the status of the constraints. Recall that the Par. Inc., problem had four less-than-or-equal-to constraints corresponding to the hours available in each of four production departments.
